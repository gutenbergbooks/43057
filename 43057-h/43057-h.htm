<p class="center bpad">135&ndash;106 <span class="smcap smaller">B.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;E.</span></p>

<p>The reign of Hyrcanus is at once the pinnacle and
the turning-point of this period. He not only carried
on his father's work, but completed it. Under
his predecessors Judæa was confined to a narrow
space, and even within these bounds there were
territories in the possession of foreign foes. Hyrcanus
enlarged the boundaries to the north and to
the south, and thus released the State from the external
pressure that had been restricting its growth.
His genius for war was aided by fortunate circumstances
in bringing about these happy results.</p>

<p>If the reign of Hyrcanus corresponds in brilliancy
to that of Solomon, it resembles it also in another
respect: both reigns commenced and ended amid
disturbance, sadness and gloom, while the middle of
each reign was happy and prosperous. When Solomon
first came to the throne he was opposed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
Adonijah, the pretender to the crown, whom he had
to subdue; and upon Hyrcanus a similar but more
difficult task devolved&mdash;that of carrying on a struggle
with several opponents. One of these opponents
was his brother-in-law, Ptolemy ben Habub,
the murderer of his father, who had also sought after
Hyrcanus's own life. It was only the support of the
Syrian army, however, which could make Ptolemy
dangerous, the inhabitants of Jerusalem having instantly
declared themselves in favor of Hyrcanus
as the successor of the murdered Simon. Still, both
his safety and his duty called upon him to punish
this unscrupulous enemy, and to avenge his father's
death. Hyrcanus hastened, therefore, to attack him
in his fortress before Antiochus could bring his troops
to his relief. There is some uncertainty as to the
progress of this siege and its result; according to
one account, evidently somewhat embellished, Hyrcanus
could not put his whole strength against the
fortress, because his mother (by some it is said, together
with his brothers) had been placed on the walls
by Ptolemy, and was there horribly tortured. Like a
true Hasmonæan, the heroic woman is said to have
encouraged her son to continue the siege, without
heeding her sufferings, and to persevere in his efforts
until the murderer of her family should receive the
chastisement due to his crimes. Hyrcanus's heart
was torn by conflicting feelings; revenge towards
his reckless foe urged him on, whilst tender pity for
his mother held him back. The fact is, however,
that Hyrcanus withdrew without accomplishing his
purpose. It may have been the Sabbatical year
which prevented him from proceeding with the siege,
or, as is much more likely, his operations may have
been interrupted by the approach of the Syrian king,
who was advancing with his army to glean some
advantage for himself from the troubles and the
confusion in Judæa. After the withdrawal of Hyrcanus's
troops, it is said that his mother and brothers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
were put to death by Ptolemy, who fled to Philadelphia,
the former Ammonite capital (Rabbath Ammon),
where he was favorably received by the
governor, Zeno Cotylas. The name of Ptolemy is
no more mentioned, and he disappears altogether
from the page of history.</p>

<p>A far greater danger now threatened Hyrcanus
from Antiochus Sidetes, who was eager to avenge
the recent defeat sustained by the Syrians (autumn
135). He marched forth with a large army, devastated
the country round about, and approached the
capital. Hyrcanus, doubtless feeling himself unable
to cope with his enemy in the open field, shut himself
up behind the strong walls of Jerusalem. Antiochus
laid regular siege to the city and encircled
it with elaborate preparations for its conquest.
Seven camps were stationed around the city; on
the north side, where the country is flat, a hundred
three-storied towers were erected from which the
walls could be stormed. A broad double trench
was likewise made to prevent the sallies of the
Judæans, who contrived nevertheless to come forth,
thus bravely impeding the work of the enemy, and
obstructing the progress of the siege. The Syrian
army suffered much from the want of water and
from sickness, the natural consequence of that deficiency.
The besieged were well supplied with
water, but food became scarce, and Hyrcanus found
himself compelled to commit an act of cruelty. In
order to husband the failing provisions, the inhabitants
who could not bear arms were sent out of the
city. Perhaps the hope was entertained that the
enemy would take pity on them. But to the defenseless,
foes are seldom generous. They were
not allowed to pass the lines of the besieging army,
and were thus exposed to death from both sides.
In the meantime the summer passed, and still no
prospect of storming the walls offered itself to the
Syrians, whilst the Judæans, on account of the scarcity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
of provisions and the approaching holidays,
were anxious for a truce. Hyrcanus made the first
overtures, and asked for a cessation of arms during
the seven days of the Feast of Tabernacles. Antiochus
not only granted that request, but sent him
presents of animals with gilded horns for sacrificial
purposes, and golden vessels filled with incense.
Negotiations for peace followed upon this truce.
Antiochus was urged by his advisers to show the
greatest severity in his demands upon the Judæans.
They reminded him of the policy of Antiochus Epiphanes,
who knew no other way of crushing out the
hatred of mankind felt by the Judæans than that of
obliging them to renounce their peculiar laws. If
Antiochus Sidetes had listened to these prejudiced
counselors, who saw, according to the biased views
of that time, nothing but cynical exclusiveness in the
singular customs of the Judæans, the cruel wars in
which the people had fought for their faith would
have been repeated. Happily for them, Antiochus
had neither the harshness nor the strength to venture
upon so dangerous a game. Antiochus contented
himself with destroying the battlements of
Jerusalem (autumn 134). With that act the dark
cloud which had menaced the independence of
Judæa passed away.</p>

<p>No great injury had been inflicted upon the State,
and even the traces of disaster that had been left were
soon obliterated. For Hyrcanus now sent an embassy
to Rome consisting of three delegates: Simon,
the son of Dositheus, Apollonius, the son of Alexander,
and Diodorus, the son of Jason, to entreat
the Senate to renew, with the Jewish commonwealth,
the friendly treaties, which Rome lavishly accorded
to the smallest nations. At the same time they
were to complain that Antiochus Sidetes had taken
possession of several places in Judæa, and among
them the important fortresses of Joppa and Gazara.
Rome always sided with the weak against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
strong, not from a sense of justice but from self-interested
calculation. She desired especially to
humble the royal house of the Seleucidæ, which
had occasionally shown her a defiant, or at least a
haughty mien. The Judæan ambassadors were
consequently most favorably received, their requests
listened to with attention, and a decree
issued by which Antiochus was called upon to restore
the fortresses he had taken, and to forbid his troops
to march through Judæa; nor was he to treat its
inhabitants as his subjects (about 133). Antiochus
appears to have acquiesced in this decision.</p>

<p>He was, moreover, obliged to assume a friendly
demeanor towards Hyrcanus; for at that moment
he was meditating an attack against Parthia, which
had formerly belonged to, but had since separated
itself from the kingdom of his ancestors. His
brother, Demetrius Nicator, had likewise undertaken
an expedition against the Parthians, but had sustained
a defeat, and was kept in imprisonment for
nearly ten years. Antiochus believed that he would
be more fortunate than his brother. In addition to
the army of 80,000 which he had assembled, he
requested the aid of Judæan troops and of the
forces of other surrounding nations, and Hyrcanus
consented to join with his army in the expedition.
The Syrian king treated his Judæan allies with the
greatest regard. After a victory gained on the
banks of the river Zab (Lycus), he ordered, according
to the desire of Hyrcanus, that a two days'
respite should take place, so that the Judæans might
celebrate their Sabbath and the festival of the Feast
of Weeks which followed it (129).</p>

<p>Fortune, however, had changed sides since the
time of Antiochus the Great, and no longer favored
the Seleucidæan dynasty. Antiochus lost his life in
this campaign, and his brother Demetrius, who had
been set at liberty by the king of Parthia at the time
of the invasion of Antiochus, to be opposed to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
as a rival monarch, now reigned in his brother's
stead (from 128&ndash;125). Hated by the Syrians on
account of his long imprisonment in Parthia, Demetrius
was opposed by a rival, Alexander Zabina,
whom Ptolemy Physcon had set up against him.
Demetrius was obliged to flee before Zabina, and
could not even find a refuge in Accho, where his wife
Cleopatra resided. Syria fell into a state of still
greater confusion under his successors, when Zabina
disputed the throne with the legitimate heir, Antiochus
VIII, the latter finding likewise a competitor
in his brother on the mother's side, Antiochus IX.
The last pages of the history of Syria are stained
with crimes caused by the deadly hatred of the
various members of the Seleucidæan house against
each other, and with the murders they committed.
Soon after the death of her husband Demetrius,
Cleopatra had one of her sons, Seleucus, killed, and
mixed the poisoned cup for the other one, Antiochus
Grypus, who forced her to drink it herself.</p>

<p>Hyrcanus took advantage of this state of anarchy
and weakness in Syria, which lasted several years,
to enlarge the boundaries of Judæa, until his country
attained its former limits. Soon after the death of
Antiochus Sidetes, the last traces of vassalage to
which the siege of Jerusalem had reduced Judæa
were completely wiped out, and even the bonds of
alliance were canceled, whilst Alexander Zabina
was grateful to be acknowledged by Hyrcanus
as king of Syria. It was at this period (124) that
the inhabitants of Jerusalem, particularly those
included in the great council, made an appeal to the
Egyptian community and to the priest, Judas Aristobulus,
teacher to the king, and of priestly lineage,
to allow the anniversaries of the consecration of the
Temple and of the victory over the sinners to be
numbered among the memorial holidays of the
nation. To strengthen their request they referred
to the unexpected help which God had given His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
people in the evil days of Antiochus, enabling them
to restore the sanctuary to its former purity. This
appeal from Judæa was at the same time a hint to
the Alexandrian community to acknowledge the new
conditions that had arisen.</p>

<p>John Hyrcanus, who until then had acted only in
self-defense, was now, after the fall of Alexander
Zabina (123), ready to strike energetically at Syria.
Judæa at that time was encompassed on three sides
by foreign tribes: on the south by the Idumæans,
on the north by the hated Samaritans, and beyond
the Jordan by the Greeks, who had never been
friendly to the Judæans. Hyrcanus therefore considered
it his mission to reconquer all those lands, and
either to expel their inhabitants or to incorporate
them with the Judæans; for so long as foreign and
hostile tribes existed in the very heart of the country,
its political independence and religious stability
would be in constant danger. Not only were these
hostile peoples ever ready to join surrounding
nations, and assist them in their greed for conquest,
but they also often interfered with the religious
worship of the Judæans, thus frequently giving rise
to acts of violence and bloodshed. Hyrcanus was
consequently impelled by religious as well as by
political motives to tear up these hotbeds of
constant disturbance and hostility.</p>

<p>To accomplish so great a task Hyrcanus required
all the strength he could muster, and, in order not
to tax too heavily the military resources of the
nation, he employed mercenaries, whom, it is said,
he paid out of the treasures he had found in David's
sepulcher. The first place he attacked was Medaba,
in the Jordan district. That city was taken after a
six months' siege. Then the army moved on
towards Samega, which, situated on the southern
end of the Sea of Tiberias, must have been a place
of great importance to the Judæans. Next in turn
came the towns of Samaria; its capital, Shechem, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
well as the temple erected on Mount Gerizim, which
had always been a thorn in the side of the Judæans,
were destroyed (21 Kislev, about 120). The anniversary
of the destruction of this temple (Yom har
Gerizim) was to be kept with great rejoicing, as the
commemoration of a peculiarly happy event, and no
fasting or mourning was ever to mar the brightness
of the festival. From this time forth the glory of
the Samaritans waned; for, although centuries to
come still found them a peculiar people, and, at the
present day even, they continue to exist and to offer
sacrifice on Mount Gerizim, still, from the want of a
central rallying point, they gradually decreased in
numbers and prosperity.</p>

<p>After his victory over the Samaritans, Hyrcanus
marched against the Idumæans. This people,
although fallen very low during the many vicissitudes
of fortune attending the constant changes of
the Macedonian and Asiatic dynasties, and forced
by the Nabathæans to leave their dwellings, had
alone, among all the tribes related by blood to the
Judæans, been able to maintain themselves, and had
preserved their ancient bitter animosity against
them undiminished. Hyrcanus laid siege to their
two fortresses, Adora and Marissa, and after having
demolished them, gave the Idumæans the choice
between acceptance of Judaism and exile. They
chose the former alternative, and became, outwardly,
followers of that faith. The temples of the
Idumæan idols were, of course, destroyed, but the
priests secretly adhered to their worship. Thus, after
more than a thousand years of enmity, Jacob and Esau
were again united&mdash;the elder serving the younger
brother. For the first time Judaism, in the person
of its head, John Hyrcanus, practised intolerance
against other faiths, but it soon found out with deep
pain how highly injurious it is to allow religious zeal
for the preservation of the faith to degenerate into
the desire to effect violent conversion of others.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
The enforced union of the sons of Edom with the
sons of Jacob was fraught only with disaster to the
latter. It was through the Idumæans and the
Romans that the Hasmonæan dynasty was overthrown
and the Judæan state destroyed.</p>

<p>The first result of the conquest of the Idumæans
and of their adoption of Judaism was a new contest
with the city of Samaria, now chiefly inhabited by
Macedonians and Syrians. A colony of Idumæans
had been transplanted from Marissa to the vicinity of
Samaria. They were attacked and ill-treated by
their neighbors, who were urged on to their acts of
aggression by the Syrian kings, Grypus and Cyzicenus.
The latter, who resembled Antiochus Epiphanes
in his folly and extravagance, manifested in
particular a fierce hatred against Hyrcanus. His
generals invaded Judæa, took several fortresses
near the sea-coast, and placed a garrison in Joppa.
Hyrcanus thereupon complained to the Roman
Senate, which had guaranteed to Judæa the possession
of this seaport, and sent five ambassadors to
plead the justice of his cause at Rome. Among
these was Apollonius, the son of Alexander, who
had appeared before the Senate in a former embassy.
Rome replied in fair words to the petition of Hyrcanus,
and promulgated a decree forbidding Antiochus
Cyzicenus to molest the Judæans, who were
the allies of Rome, and commanding him to restore
all the fortresses, seaports and territories which he
had seized. It was further ordered that the Judæans
should be allowed to ship their goods duty free from
their ports, a favor not granted to any other allied
nation or king, excepting the king of Egypt, who
was regarded as the peculiar friend of Rome, and
finally that the Syrian garrison should evacuate
Joppa. Whether the sentence pronounced by Rome
had any great effect upon Antiochus Cyzicenus or
not, the fact that it was not adverse to Hyrcanus
was so far a boon that it strengthened his cause. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
appears to have restrained Cyzicenus within certain
bounds.</p>

<p>When, however, Hyrcanus, bent upon punishing
Samaria for its enmity to the people of Marissa,
besieged that city, causing famine within its walls by
closely surrounding it with trenches and ramparts,
and thus cutting off every possibility of exit, Cyzicenus
came to its assistance. In an engagement with
Aristobulus, the eldest son of Hyrcanus, who was
conducting the siege conjointly with his younger
brother Antigonus, Cyzicenus was defeated and
forced to flee to Bethshean (Scythopolis). Too weak
to confront the Judæans alone, he called to his help
the co-regent of Egypt, Ptolemy VIII (Lathurus),
who, inspired by the hatred entertained by the
Egyptians against the Judæans, readily complied
with that request. His mother Cleopatra, with
whom the people had obliged him to share the government,
was secretly in league against him, befriending,
like her parents, the cause of Judæa. Two sons
of Onias IV, Helkias and Ananias, sided with her.
It was doubtless on that account that her son took
an aversion to the Judæans, and gladly came forth at
the call of Cyzicenus to compel Hyrcanus to withdraw
from the siege of Samaria. Despite the wishes
of his mother, Lathurus sent an army of six thousand
men to support Cyzicenus against Judæa. Too
weak to venture on meeting the Judæan troops in
the open field, the operations were confined to laying
waste the country around, in the hope of thus
impeding the work of the besiegers. The Judæan
princes, however, instead of being forced to abandon
the siege, contrived by various man&oelig;uvres to compel
the king of Syria to leave the scene of action and to
withdraw to Tripolis. During one of the battles in
which Cyzicenus was beaten, it is said that a voice
from the Holy of Holies was heard announcing to
Hyrcanus, at the very moment in which it took place,
the victory achieved by his sons. He is said to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
heard the following words pronounced in Aramaic:
"The young princes have defeated Antiochus."
The two generals, Callimandrus and Epicrates, whom
Lathurus had left behind to continue the hostilities,
were not more fortunate than himself, for the first
lost his life in some engagement, the second succumbed
to bribery, and delivered into the hands of the
Judæan princes the town of Bethshean, as well as
other places in the plain of Jezreel, as far as Mount
Carmel, which had been held by the Greeks or the
Syrians. The heathen inhabitants were instantly
expelled from the newly conquered cities, and the
anniversaries of the recovery of Bethshean and of
the Plain (Bekaata), 15&ndash;16 Sivan (June, 109), were
added henceforth to the days of victory. Samaria,
no longer able to rely upon foreign help, was obliged
to capitulate, and after a year's siege was given up
to the conqueror. Actuated either by revenge or
prudence, Hyrcanus caused Samaria to be utterly
destroyed, and ditches and canals to be dug through
the place, so that not a trace should remain of the
once flourishing city. The day of its surrender was
added to the number of days of thanksgiving (25th
Marcheshvan, November, 109).</p>

<p>Thus Hyrcanus had carried out the comprehensive
plans of the Hasmonæans and crowned them
with success. The independence of Judæa was
assured, and the country raised to the level of the
neighboring states. The enemies who had menaced
it from every side, Syrians, Idumæans, Samaritans,
were nearly all conquered, and the land was delivered
from the bonds which had hitherto prevented
its development. The glorious era of David and
Solomon seemed to have returned, foreign tribes
were obliged to do homage to the ruler of Judæa, the
old hatred between the latter and Idumæa was blotted
out, and Jacob and Esau again became twin brothers.
Moabitis, the daughter of Arnon, again sent presents
to the mountain of the daughter of Zion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
The banks of the Jordan, the sea-coast, the caravan
tracks that passed from Egypt through Syria, were
all under the dominion of Judæa. She saw also the
humiliation of her enemy, Ptolemy Lathurus. The
latter was living in constant discord with his mother,
the co-regent, who at last aroused the anger of the
people against him to such a degree that he was
obliged to flee from Alexandria (108). He took
refuge in the island of Cyprus, whither Cleopatra
despatched an army in pursuit of him. But the
troops sent to destroy him went over to his side.
The Judæan soldiers who came from the province
of Onion, commanded by the generals Helkias and
Ananias, the sons of Onias, alone remained faithful
to the Queen, and vigorously attacked Ptolemy to
force him to leave the island. In Alexandria as in
Judæa, at that time, the Judæans played a leading
role, and worked together in a common cause for
mutual advantage. They fought against common
foes, against Lathurus and his ally, Antiochus
Cyzicenus.</p>

<p>After all he had achieved for his country, it was only
natural that Hyrcanus should cause Judæan coins to
be struck, and should inscribe them in old Hebrew
characters, but he abandoned the modest example
of his father and allowed his own name to appear
on them, "Jochanan, High Priest." Upon some of
the coins we find, next his name, the inscription
"and the Commonwealth of the Judæans" (Cheber
ha-Jehudim), as though he felt it necessary to indicate
that it was in the name of the people that he had
exercised the right of coinage. Upon other coins,
however, we find the following words inscribed:
"Jochanan, High Priest, and head of the Commonwealth
of the Judæans" (Rosch Cheber ha-Jehudim).
Instead of the lily which was graven on his father's
coins, he chose an emblem similar to that of the
Macedonian conquerors&mdash;the horn of plenty. Towards
the end of his reign Hyrcanus assumed more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
the character of a worldly potentate, and became
more and more ambitious. His constant aim was to
enlarge his country and to increase his own power.
Hyrcanus appears to have cast a wistful eye upon
the widely-extended territory which commanded the
route to Damascus. The conquest of Ituræa, a tract
of country lying to the east of Mount Hermon, which
his successors completed, appears to have been
planned by him. But a formidable disturbance in the
land, which he was unable to suppress, speedily
followed by his own death, prevented him from
carrying out this undertaking. And this disturbance,
apparently insignificant in its beginning, took
so unfortunate a turn that the great Hasmonæan
edifice, built up with so much labor and care, was
completely destroyed. For the second time the
Judæan State, having reached its highest pinnacle
of prosperity, ascertained that it was not to maintain
itself in external greatness.</p>

<p>The high tide of political development, which swept
over Judæa whilst that country was under the dominion
of John Hyrcanus and his predecessors, could
not fail to permeate the life of the people, and in
particular to stimulate all their spiritual powers.
With only short interruptions they had, during half a
century, been continually engaged in a warfare in
which they were alternately victorious and defeated,
and in which, being brought into contact with various
nations, now as friends, now as foes, they attained
a greater maturity, and their former simple existence
rose to a more complex and a higher life. The
hard struggles by which they had achieved independence
caused them to examine more curiously
into their own condition, and to hold fast to their
national traits; but it led them also to adopt those
foreign views and practices which appeared to blend
harmoniously with their own. If the pious Judæans
had formerly opposed with all their might everything
that bore the Hellenic impress, many of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
were now convinced that among the customs of
Greece there might occasionally be something which
they could adopt without prejudice or injury to their
own faith. The Hasmonæans had not only learnt
from their neighbors the arts of war, how to fashion
arms and construct fortresses, but also the peaceful
arts of coining money with artistic ornamentation,
and the rules of Greek architecture. A magnificent
palace, evidently built in the Grecian style, arose
in Jerusalem. In front of the Hasmonæan Palace,
near the valley-like hollow which divided the higher
town from the Temple, there was a wide covered
colonnade, called the "Xystum," where the people
assembled. A bridge led across from the Xystum
to the west gate of the furthest court of the Temple.
There was likewise a building erected in the higher
town, devoted to judicial meetings, constructed
according to Grecian art; with it was combined a
Record Office, where important archives were kept.
John Hyrcanus also erected, in the Grecian style, a
family mausoleum in Modin, the birthplace of the
Hasmonæans. It consisted of a lofty building of
white polished marble. Around it was a colonnade,
and on the columns were beautiful carvings of various
weapons and figureheads of ships. Seven pyramids
crowned the edifice, in memory of the progenitors
of the Hasmonæans and their five heroic sons.
The Hasmonæan mausoleum was of so great a height
that it was visible from the sea.</p>

<p>The tendency of the Judæans of that period, however,
was more especially directed to the maintenance
and development of all that belonged peculiarly
to themselves than to the acquiring of the arts
of foreign civilization. The Hebrew language, which,
since the close contact of the people with Asiatic
nations, had been almost superseded by the Aramaic,
appeared now to be celebrating to a certain
extent its renaissance; it was rejuvenated and became,
for the second time, though in an altered form,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
the language of the people. It was rendered precious
to them through the Holy Scriptural records which
they had preserved from destruction, and which had
ever been the source of their zeal and enthusiasm.
Their coins were, as mentioned before, stamped in
Hebrew, public records were written in Hebrew, and
the songs of the people were sung in the same language.
Though some prevalent Aramaic names
were still retained, and Grecian numbers were
adopted, the Hebrew language showed its strong
vitality by enriching its vocabulary with new forms
of words, and stamping the foreign elements it
admitted with its own mark. The form that Hebrew
assumed from this time forth is called the "New
Hebrew." It was distinguished from the old Hebrew
by greater clearness and facility, even though it
lacked the depth and poetical fervor of the latter.
At the same time Greek was understood by all the
leaders and statesmen of the community. It was
the language made use of in their intercourse with
the Syrian kings, and was likewise spoken by their
ambassadors to the Roman Senate. Along with
Jewish names, Greek names appeared now more
frequently than before. The character of the literature
was also marked by the change which took
place in the spirit of the people at this period of its
revival. The sweet note of song was mute; not a
trace of poetical creation has come down to us from
this and the next epoch. The nation called no
longer for the fiery inspiration which flows through
the lyric songs of the Psalms, and it could not furnish
matter for mournful elegies. What it required to
promote religious sentiment and fervor was already
provided by the poetry of the Temple, and in the rich
stores of the Scriptures the people found knowledge
and instruction. Sober history now took the place of
triumphant hymns, and related facts and deeds for
the use of posterity. History was the only branch
of literature which was cultivated, and the recent past<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
and the immediate present furnished the historian's
pen with ample subjects. That Hebrew was used
in historical writings is shown by the fragments
which have come down to us. The so-called first
book of the Maccabees, which was written in Hebrew,
(but is now extant only in a Greek translation)
is a proof of the inherent power of rejuvenescence
belonging to the language.</p>

<p>The change in the current of life, caused by political
events, showed itself even more in the sphere
of religion than in the literature and habits of the
people in general. The victory over the Syrians,
the expulsion of the Hellenists, the subjection of the
Idumæans, the humiliation of the Samaritans, culminating
in the destruction of the Temple of Gerizim,
were so many triumphs of Judaism over its enemies,
and were sanctioned as such by the champions of
the religious party. In order to stamp them indelibly
on the memory of future generations, their anniversaries
were to be kept like the days of the consecration
of the Temple. Religion was still the great
underlying impulse in all movements, and showed
its strength even in the abuse to which it gave rise
when it forced Judaism upon the heathens. In the
meantime the religious consciousness of the people
shone with a clearer light in consequence of the
wider field upon which it had entered; the wider view
which had been gained into the various relations of
life, the advance out of the narrow circle of tradition
and inherited customs, produced schism and separation
amongst the Judæans themselves. The strict
religious party of Assidæans withdrew from the
scene of passing events, and, in order to avoid
mixing in public life, they sought a secluded retreat
where they could give themselves up to undisturbed
meditation. In this solitude they formed themselves
into a distinct order, with strange customs and new
views, and received the name of Essenes. Their
example, however, of giving up all active share in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
the public weal was not followed by all the strictly
devout Judæans, the majority of whom, on the contrary,
whilst firmly adhering to the precepts of their
faith, considered it a religious duty to further the
independence of their country. Thus there arose a
division among the pious, and a national party
separated itself from the Assidæans or Essenes,
which did not avoid public life, but, according
to its strength and ability, took an active part in
public affairs. The members of this numerous sect
began at this time to bear the name of Pharisees
(Perushim). But this sect, the very center, as it
were, of the nation, having above all things at heart
the preservation of Judaism in the exact form in
which it had been handed down, insisted upon all
political undertakings, all public transactions, every
national act being tried by the standard of religion.
To these demands, however, those who stood at the
head of military or diplomatic affairs, and who saw
how difficult it was always to deal with political
matters according to the strict claims of their faith,
would not or could not reconcile themselves. Thus
a third party was formed&mdash;that of the Sadducees
(Zadukim)&mdash;the members of which, without forsaking
the religion, yet made the interests of the nation
their chief care and object. Of these sects&mdash;the
Assidæan-Essenes, the Pharisees, and the Sadducees&mdash;only
the last two exerted a powerful influence upon
the course of events. At what precise period opposition
began to show itself among these several
parties cannot be determined, as indeed the birth of
new spiritual tendencies must ever remain shrouded
from view. According to one account, the adverse
parties first appeared at the time of Jonathan.</p>

<p>The Pharisees (Perushim) can only be called a
party figuratively and by way of distinction from the
other two, for the mass of the nation was inclined to
Phariseeism, and it was only in the national leaders
that its peculiarities became marked. The Pharisees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
received their name from the fact of their <i>explaining</i>
the Scriptures in a peculiar manner, and of deriving
new laws from this new interpretation. As expounders
of the law the Pharisees formed the
learned body of the nation. Their opinions were
framed, their actions governed by one cardinal
principle&mdash;the necessity of preserving Judaism.
The individual and the State were to be ruled alike
by the laws and customs of their fathers. Every
deviation from this principle appeared to the Pharisees
as treason to all that was most precious and
holy. To their opponents, the Sadducees, who
argued that, unless other measures were used for
political purposes, weighty national interests would
be often wrecked by religious scruples, the Pharisees
replied that the fate of the State, like that of the
individual, depended not upon man but upon God.
It was not human strength, nor human wisdom, nor
the warrior's prowess that could determine the weal
or the woe of the Judæan people, but Divine Providence
alone. Everything happened according to
the eternal decrees of the Divine will. Man was
responsible only for his moral conduct and the individual
path he trod. The results of all human
endeavors lay outside the range of human calculation.
From this, the Pharisees' view of life, the
rival opinion of the Sadducees diverged; whilst
the Essenes, on the contrary, exaggerated it.
Another view of the Pharisees was probably directed
against the following objection urged by the Sadducees: If
the fate of the individual or of the State
did not depend upon the actions of the one or the
policy of the other, there would be an end to Divine
justice; misfortune might then assail the righteous
man, whilst the sun of happiness smiled upon the
sinner. This reproach the Pharisees set aside by
the doctrine, borrowed from another source, which
taught that Divine justice would manifest itself not
during life but after death. God will rouse the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
dead out of the sleep of the grave; He will reward
the righteous according to their works, and punish
the wicked for their evil deeds. "Those will rise
up to everlasting life, and these to everlasting
shame."</p>

<p>These views, however, precisely because they
concerned only the inner convictions of men, did
not mark the opposition between the parties so
clearly as did the third dogma of the Pharisees,
establishing the importance and all-embracing influence
of religious injunctions. In a nation whose
breath of life was religion, many customs whose
origin was lost in the dim twilight of the past had
taken their place by the side of the written Law.
If these customs were not found in the books of the
Law they were ascribed to the great teachers (the
Sopherim and the great assembly&mdash;Keneseth hagedolah),
which, at the time of the return of the
Captivity, had given form and new vigor to the
religious sentiment, and at the head of which stands
the illustrious expounder of Scripture, Ezra. Such
religious customs were called the legacies of the
teachers of the Law (Dibre Sopherim). All these
unwritten customs, which lived in the heart of the
nation and, as it were, grew with its growth, gained
an extraordinary degree of importance from the
dangers that Judaism had encountered and the victories
that it had achieved. The people had risked,
in behalf of these very customs, their property and
their life; and the martyrdom that many of the
faithful had undergone, and the antagonism they felt
towards the renegade and frivolous Hellenists, had
much increased the reverence and attachment with
which these customs were regarded. The Temple,
especially, which had been so ruthlessly defiled and
afterwards been reconsecrated in so marvelous a
manner, had become doubly precious to the whole
people, who were determined to keep it free from
the faintest breath of desecration. The Levitical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
rules of purity, so far as they related to the Temple,
were therefore observed with peculiar care and
rigorous strictness.</p>

<p>But this devotion to outward forms and ceremonies
by no means excluded the religion of the heart. The
Pharisees were acknowledged to be moral, chaste,
temperate and benevolent. In their administration
of justice they allowed mercy to prevail, and judged
the accused not from the point of view of moral
depravity but from that of human weakness. The
following maxim was given by Joshua, the son of
Perachia, one of the leaders of the sect, who, with
his companion, Matthai of Arbela, lived in the
time of Hyrcanus: "Take a teacher, win a friend,
and judge every man from the presumption of innocence."
His high moral temperament is indicated
by this maxim. Their rigid adherence to the Law,
and their lenient mildness and indulgence in other
matters, gained for the Pharisees the deep veneration
of the whole people. Of this sect were the
pious priests, the teachers of the Law, and, above
all, the magistrates, civil and religious, who at that
time often combined both offices in one. The whole
inner direction of the State and the Temple was in
their hands. But the Pharisees owed their influence
chiefly to their knowledge of the Law and to the
application they made of it to the affairs of daily life,
and they alone were called the interpreters and
teachers of the Law. The degrading charge of
hypocrisy, which was applied to them by their
enemies in later times, they by no means merited,
and, indeed, it is altogether preposterous to stigmatize
a whole class of men as dissemblers. They
were rather, in their origin, the noblest guardians
and representatives of Judaism and strict morality.
Even their rivals, the Sadducees, could not but
bear witness to the fact that "they denied themselves
in this world, but would hardly receive a reward in
a future world."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
This party of the Sadducees, so sharply opposed
to the Pharisees, pursued a national-political policy.
It was composed of the Judæan aristocracy, the
brave soldiers, the generals and the statesmen who
had acquired wealth and authority at home, or who
had returned from foreign embassies, all having
gained, from closer intercourse with the outer world
and other lands, freer thought and more worldly
views. They formed the kernel of the Hasmonæan
following, which in peace or war faithfully served
their leaders. This sect doubtless included also
some Hellenists, who, shrinking from the desertion
of their faith, had returned to Judaism. The Sadducees
probably derived their name from one of their
leaders, Zadok. The national interests of the
Judæan community were placed by the Sadducees
above the Law. Burning patriotism was their ruling
sentiment, and piety occupied but the second
place in their hearts. As experienced men of the
world, they felt that the independence of the State
could not be upheld by the strictest observance
of the laws of religion alone, nor by mere reliance
upon Divine protection. They proceeded from this
fundamental principle: man must exert his bodily
strength and his spiritual powers; he must not allow
himself to be kept back by religious scruples from
forming political alliances, or from taking part in
wars, although by so doing he must inevitably
infringe some of the injunctions of religion. According
to the Sadducæan views, it was for that
purpose that God bestowed free will upon man so
that he himself should work out his own well-being;
he is master of his fate, and human concerns are not
at all swayed by Divine interposition. Reward and
punishment are the natural consequences of our
actions, and are therefore quite independent of
resurrection. Without exactly denying the immortality
of the soul, the Sadducees completely repudiated
the idea of judgment <i>after</i> death. Oppressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
by the abundance of religious ordinances, they would
not admit their general applicability nor the obligation
of keeping them. Pressed to give some standard
by which the really important decrees might be
recognized, they laid down the following rule: that
only the ordinances which appeared clearly expressed
in the Pentateuch were binding. Those
which rested upon oral tradition, or had sprung up
at various times, had a subordinate value and could
not claim to be inviolable. Still they could not help
occasionally recognizing the value of traditional
interpretations.</p>

<p>From a number of individual instances in which
the Sadducees separated themselves from their
rivals, one can mark the extent of their opposition
to the latter. This appeared in their judiciary and
penal laws and in the ritual they adopted, their
worship in the Temple being in particular a subject
of angry controversy. The Sadducees thought that
the punishment ordered by the Pentateuch for the
infliction of any bodily injury&mdash;"an eye for an eye,
a tooth for a tooth"&mdash;should be literally interpreted
and followed out, and obtained in consequence the
reputation of being cruel administrators of justice;
whilst the Pharisees, appealing to traditional interpretations
of the Scriptures, allowed mercy to preponderate,
and only required a pecuniary compensation
from the offender. The Sadducees, on the
other hand, were more lenient in their judgment of
those false witnesses whose evidence might have
occasioned a judicial murder, as they only inflicted
punishment if the execution of the defendant had
actually taken place. There were many points relating
to the ritual which were warmly disputed by
the two parties; for instance, the date of the Feast of
Weeks, which, according to the Sadducees, should
always fall upon a Sunday, fifty days from the
Sabbath after the Passover; so also the pouring of
water on the altar and the processions round it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
with willow branches during the seven days of the
Feast of Tabernacles, which the Pharisees advocated
and the Sadducees rejected. The latter objected
to the providing of the national offerings out of the
treasury of the Temple, and insisted that the required
sacrifices should be left to the care and zeal
of individuals. The manner in which the frankincense
should be kindled on the Day of Atonement,
whether before or after the entrance of the
high priest into the Holy of Holies, was also the
cause of bitter strife. On these and other points
of dispute the Sadducees invariably followed the
exact letter of the Law, which resulted in their
occasionally enforcing stricter rules than the Pharisees,
who have been so much abused for their rigid
austerity. To one Levitical injunction, however,
they paid but little attention&mdash;that of carefully
avoiding the touch of any person or thing considered
unclean&mdash;and when their rivals purified
the vessels of the Temple after they had been
subject to any contact of the sort, they ridiculed
them, saying, "It wants but little, and the Pharisees
will try and cleanse the sun."</p>

<p>In spite of the relief which these less stringent
views gave the people, the Sadducees were not
popular; the feeling of the time was against laxity
and in favor of strict religious observance. Besides,
the Sadducees repelled their countrymen by
their proud, haughty demeanor and their severe
judicial sentences. They never gained the heart of
the public, and it was only by force and authority that
they were able to make their principles prevail.
At that period the religious sentiment was so active
that it gave birth to a religious order which far
surpassed even the Pharisees in strictness and
painful scrupulousness, and which became the basis
of a movement that, mixing with new elements,
produced a revolution in the history of the world.
This order, which, from a small and apparently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
insignificant origin, grew into a mighty power,
destined to exert an irresistible influence, was that
of the Essenes.</p>

<p>The origin of this remarkable Essene order, which
called forth the admiration even of the Greeks and
the Romans, can be dated from the period of
great religious enthusiasm excited by the tyranny
and persecutions of the Syrians. The Essenes had
never formed a political party, but, on the contrary,
avoided the glare and tumult of public life. They
did not place themselves in harsh antagonism to
the Pharisees, but rather assumed the position of a
higher grade of Pharisaism, to which party they
originally belonged. They sprang without doubt
from the Assidæans, whom they resembled in their
strict observance of the Sabbath. In their eyes the
mere act of moving a vessel from one place to
another would count as a desecration of that holy
day. Even the calls of nature were not attended
to on that day. They lived in all respects like the
Nazarites, whose ideal it was to attain the highest
sanctity of priestly consecration. It was their constant
endeavor, not only to observe all the outward
Levitical laws, but to attain through them to
inward sanctity and consecration, to deaden their
passions and to lead a holy life. The Levitical
laws of cleanliness had, through custom and tradition,
developed to such a pitch that their austere
observers must have been in constant danger of
being defiled by contact with persons and objects;
and bathing and sacrifices were prescribed, through
which they might recover a state of purity. A
life-long Nazarite, or, what is the same thing, an
Essene, was consequently obliged to avoid any
intercourse with those who were less strict than
himself, lest he should be contaminated by their
proximity. Such considerations compelled him to
frequent the society of, and to unite himself with,
those only who shared his views. To keep their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
purity unspotted, the Essenes were thus induced to
form themselves into a separate order, the first
rule of which commanded implicit obedience to the
laws of scrupulous cleanliness. It was only those
whose views coincided with their own who could be
allowed to cook food for them, and from such likewise
had to be procured their clothes, tools, implements
of trade and other things, in order to ensure
that, in their manufacture, the laws of cleanliness
had been duly carried out. They were thus
completely set apart by themselves; and, in order
to keep clear of any less strictly rigid observers,
they thought it advisable to have their meals in
common. Thus the Passover supper, which could
be partaken of only in a circle of fellow-worshipers,
must have been their ideal repast. It
was almost impossible for Essenes to mix with
women, as by the slightest contact with them they
risked coming under the Levitical condemnation of
uncleanliness, and, led on from one deduction to
another, they began to avoid, if not to despise, the
married state. How was it possible for the Essenes
to maintain their excessive rigidity, especially in
those warlike times? Not only the pagan enemy,
but even the Judæan warriors returning from the
battle-field, defiled by the touch of a corpse, might
bring all their precautions to naught. These fears
may have induced the Essenes to seek seclusion in
some retired place, where they could remain unvexed
by the sounds of war and undisturbed in
their mode of life by any of its necessary incidents.
They chose for their residence the desert to the
west of the Dead Sea, and settled in the oasis of
Engadi. The fruit of palm trees, which abound in
this district, partly furnished their simple fare. All
the Assidæans did not join in the asceticism of the
Essenes, nor did all the Essenes betake themselves
to the desert. Some continued to live in their own
family circles and did not renounce marriage; but,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
in consequence of their rigid scruples, they were
met by many difficulties.</p>

<p>Thus it was that celibacy and repasts held in
common came to be considered as the general and
most important characteristics of the Essenes. This
mode of living led the Essenes to divest themselves
of all their private possessions. To a member of
their sect private property could be of no use; each
one placed his fortune in the common treasury, out
of which the wants of the various members of the
order were supplied. Hence the proverb, "A
Chassid says, 'Mine and thine belong to thee'"
(not to me). There were consequently neither rich
nor poor among them, and this lack of all concern
about material matters naturally led them to abstract
their attention from everything mundane and to
concentrate it upon religious matters. They thus
avoided more and more all that pertained merely to
the world, and followed with the enthusiasm of
recluses a visionary, ideal tendency. The Essenes
were distinguished also by other peculiarities. They
were always clothed in white linen. Each of them
carried a small shovel, with which, like the Israelites
during their wanderings in the desert, they would
cover their excrements with earth and thus hide
impurity from sight. They also wore a sort of
apron or handkerchief (knaphaim), with which to dry
themselves after their frequent ablutions. In order
to remove even unperceived impurities, they, like
the priests before officiating in the Temple, bathed
every morning in fresh spring water; and from
these daily baths they were called "Morning Baptists"
(<i xml:lang="he" lang="he">Toble Shacharith</i>). The name Essene appears
likewise to have been derived from this peculiarity,
as in the Chaldaic language it means a bather
(<i xml:lang="he" lang="he">Aschai</i>, pronounced <i xml:lang="he" lang="he">Assai</i>).</p>

<p>These outward forms were, however, only the
steps that were to lead to inward purity and righteousness&mdash;the
symbols of their close communion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
with God; to which, according to the opinion of
antiquity, man could only attain by fleeing from the
world, and devoting himself to an ascetic mode of
life. The utmost simplicity in food and dress, abstinence,
and the practice of morality and self-sacrifice
were certainly virtues which adorned the Essenes,
but were not peculiar to their sect, as they belonged
equally to the Pharisees. The distinguishing traits
of the Essenes, however, were their frequent prayers,
their aversion to taking an oath, and their devoted
pursuit of a kind of mystic doctrine. Before saying
their prayers no profane word was permitted, and
at the first dawn of day, after the <i xml:lang="he" lang="he">Shema</i> had been
read, they assembled for quiet meditation, preparatory
to what was considered their real prayer, which
was always to be a spontaneous effusion of the
heart. To the Essenes their repasts were a kind
of divine service, the table on which their food was
spread, an altar, and the fare which they partook of,
a holy sacrifice, which they ate in deep and pious
meditation. No language of a worldly nature passed
their lips during their meals, and these were generally
partaken of in complete silence. This strange
silence doubtless produced a great impression upon
those who did not belong to the order; the more so,
because the real nature of this exclusive sect was
not known to its contemporaries, and everything
concerning it assumed a mysterious and awful
aspect.</p>

<p>It was not, perhaps, at first the object of the
Essenes to become absorbed in mystic lore; but
their asceticism, their intensely quiet life, which gave
them so much opportunity for meditation, their freedom
from family cares, and, lastly, their religious
visionariness, made them seek for other truths in
Judaism than appear to less subtle minds. The
name of God was to them a subject of deep contemplation,
justified in some degree by the dread which
existed among the Judæans of pronouncing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
name of the Almighty, formed of the four letters
J h w h. If the name of God be thus holy, surely
something mysterious must belong to the letters
themselves. Thus reasoned the Essenes, whose
seclusion from the world gave them abundant leisure
to ponder over this sacred enigma. So holy was
the name of God in their estimation that they refused
to take any oath which called for its use, and their
statements were attested by a simple "yes" or "no."
In close connection with the mystery attaching to
the name of God was that which they applied to the
names of angels. The Essenes faithfully handed
down in their theosophic system the names, as well
as the importance and position of the various angels.
When they endeavored to explain the meaning of
Holy Writ by their fantastic and newly discovered
ideas, what fresh phases must have presented themselves
to their distorted vision! Every word, every
expression must have revealed a hitherto unsuspected
meaning; the most difficult questions as to
the being of God, and His relations to the heavenly
powers and the lower creatures, were explained.
Through their indifference to all that concerned the
State, as well as the affairs of daily life, they gradually
led Judaism (dependent as it was on the establishment
of national prosperity) into the darkness
and exaggerations of Mysticism. Their deep and
mystic reverence for the Prophet and Lawgiver
Moses carried them to the greatest excesses. His
memory and name were endeared to all the Judæans
within and beyond Palestine. They took oaths in
the name of Moses, and bestowed that name on no
other man. But the Essenes carried their devotion
to such an extreme that he who spoke against the
name of Moses was treated as one who blasphemed
God.</p>

<p>The final aim of the Essenes was, without doubt,
the attainment to prophetic ecstasy so that they
might become worthy of the Divine Spirit (<i xml:lang="he" lang="he">Ruach Kodesh</i>).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
The Essenes believed that through an
ascetic life they might re-awaken the long-silent
echo of the Heavenly voice, and this end gained,
prophecy would be renewed, men and youths
would again behold Divine visions, once more
see the uplifting of the veil which hides the future,
and the great Messianic kingdom would be revealed.
The kingdom of Heaven (<i xml:lang="he" lang="he">Malchuth Shamaim</i>) would
commence, and all the pain and trouble of the times
would, at one stroke, be at an end.</p>

<p>The Essenes were considered not only holy men
(on account of their peculiar mode of life and visionary
views), but they were also admired as workers
of miracles. People hung upon their words and
hoped for the removal of impending evils through
their means. Some of the Essenes bore the reputation
of being able to reveal the future and interpret
dreams; they were reverenced yet more by the
ignorant, on account of their miraculous cures of
so-called "possessed" persons. The intercourse of
the Judæans with the Persians had brought with it,
together with a belief in the existence of angels, a
superstitious belief in malicious demons (<i xml:lang="he" lang="he">Shedim</i>,
<i xml:lang="he" lang="he">Mazikin</i>). Imbeciles were thought to be possessed
by evil demons, who could only be exorcised by a
magic formula; and all extraordinary illnesses were
attributed to such demons, for which the advice of
the wonder-worker, and not that of the doctor, was
sought. The Essenes occupied themselves with
cures, exorcisms, etc., and sought their remedies in
a book (<i xml:lang="he" lang="he">Sefer Refuoth</i>) which was attributed to King
Solomon, whom the nation considered as the master
of evil spirits. Their curative remedies consisted
partly in softly-spoken incantations and verses
(<i xml:lang="he" lang="he">Lechis'ha</i>), and partly in the use of certain roots
and stones supposed to possess magic power. Thus
the Essenes united the highest and the lowest aims,&mdash;the
endeavor to lead a pious life and the most
vulgar superstitions. Their exaggerated asceticism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
and fear of contact with others of a different mode
of life caused a morbidly unhealthy development
among them.</p>

<p>The more rationally-minded Pharisees paid them
but little attention; they made sport of the "foolish
Chassid." Although sprung from a common root,
the more the Pharisees and Essenes developed, the
more widely they diverged. The one party saw in
marriage a holy institution appointed for the good of
mankind, and the other an obstacle to a thoroughly
religious life. The Pharisees recognized man's free
will in thought and action, and consequently deemed
him responsible for his moral conduct. The Essenes,
on the contrary, confined to the narrow circle of their
self-same, daily-repeated duties, came to believe in
a sort of divine fatalism, which not only governed
the destiny of mankind but also ruled the acts of
each individual. The Essenes avoided the Temple,
the worship practised there being framed according
to the doctrines of the Pharisees and unable to
satisfy their ideals. They sent their offerings to the
Temple, and thus fulfilled the duty of sacrificing
without being themselves present at the ceremony.
With them, patriotism became more and more subordinate
to the devotion they felt towards their own
order, and thus by degrees they loosed themselves
from the strong bands of nationality. There lay
concealed in Essenism an element antagonistic to
existing Judaism, unsuspected by friends or foes.</p>

<p>The Essenes had no influence whatever upon
political events. Their number was small, and
even at the time of their greatest prosperity the
order consisted only of about four thousand members.
Consequent upon the life of celibacy which
they adopted, the losses made by death in their
ranks could not naturally be replaced. To avoid
dwindling away entirely, they had recourse to the
expedient of enrolling novices and making proselytes.
The new member was admitted with great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
solemnity, and presented with the white garment,
the apron, and the shovel, the symbols of Essenism.
The novice was not allowed, however, to enter immediately
into the community, but was subjected by
degrees to an ever stricter observance of the laws of
abstinence and purity. There were three probationary
degrees to be passed through before a new member
was received into complete brotherhood. At his
admission the novice swore to follow the mode of
life of the Essenes, to keep conscientiously and to
deliver faithfully the secret teachings of their order.
He who was found to be unworthy was expelled.</p>

<p>The unfriendly relationship between the Pharisees
and Sadducees did not exist in the time of Hyrcanus.
He made use of both parties according to their capabilities&mdash;the
Sadducees as soldiers or diplomatists,
and the Pharisees as teachers of the Law, judges,
and functionaries in civil affairs. The one honored
Hyrcanus as the head of the State, the other as the
pious high priest. In fact, Hyrcanus personally
favored the Pharisees, but as prince he could not
quarrel with the Sadducees, among whom he found
his soldiers, his generals and his counselors. Their
leader Jonathan was his devoted friend. Until old
age crept on him, Hyrcanus managed to solve the
difficult problem of keeping in a state of amity two
parties that were always on the verge of quarreling.
He understood how to prevent either party from
gaining the upper hand and persecuting its rival.
But (as too often happens in such difficult situations)
a word, a breath can upset the best-arranged plans,
bringing to naught the most skilful calculations, and
the slowly, carefully built edifice falls and crumbles
in a day. A heedless word of this kind turned the
zealous follower of Pharisaism into its bitter opponent.
In the last years of his life Hyrcanus went quite over
to the Sadducees.</p>

<p>The cause of this change, which brought such
unspeakable misery to the Judæan nation, was trivial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
in comparison with its results; but the antagonism
of the two parties, which could only with the utmost
difficulty be kept from breaking out into open discord,
gave it a terrible and far-reaching importance.
Hyrcanus had just returned from a glorious victory
over one of the many nations in the northeast of
Peræa (Kochalit?). Rejoicing in the happy result
of his arms and in the flourishing state of his country,
he ordered a feast to be held, to which he invited
without distinction the leaders of the Sadducees and
Pharisees. Around golden dishes laden with food
were placed various plants that grew in the desert,
to remind the guests of the hardships they had
endured under the Syrian yoke, when the nobles of
the land were obliged to hide themselves in the
wilderness. Whilst the guests were feasting,
Hyrcanus asked if the Pharisees could reproach
him for any transgression of the Law? If so,
he desired to be told in what he had failed. Was
this apparent humility only a cunningly-devised plan
to discover the real disposition of the Pharisees
towards him? Had the Sadducees inspired him
with suspicion against the Pharisees, and advised
him to find some way of proving the sincerity of
their attachment? In reply to the challenge thus
thrown out, a certain Eleazer ben Poira arose and
bluntly answered, "Hyrcanus should content himself
with the crown of royalty, and should place on
a worthier head the high priest's diadem. During
an attack on Modin by the Syrians his mother,
before his birth, was taken prisoner, and it is not
fitting for the son of a prisoner to be a priest&mdash;much
less the High Priest!" Although inwardly wounded
by so outspoken an insult to his pride, Hyrcanus
had sufficient self-possession to appear to agree with
the bold speaker and ordered the matter to be
examined. It was, however, proved to be an empty
report; in fact, without the slightest foundation.</p>

<p>Hyrcanus's anger was doubly roused against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
Pharisees through the care taken by the Sadducees
and his devoted friend Jonathan to persuade him
that the former had invented the story purposely to
lower him in the eyes of the people. Anxious to
find out if the aspersion cast on his fitness for the
high-priesthood was the act of the whole party or
only the slander of an individual, he demanded that
their leading men should punish the calumniator,
and expected that the chastisement inflicted would
be in proportion to his own exalted rank. But the
Pharisees knew of no special penalty for the slanderer
of royalty, and their judges only awarded him the
lawful punishment of thirty-nine lashes. Jonathan,
the leader of the Sadducees, failed not to use this
circumstance as a means to rake up the fire in
Hyrcanus's breast. He led him to see in this mild
judgment of the court a deep-rooted aversion entertained
by the Pharisees against him, thus estranging
him completely from his former friends, and binding
him heart and soul to the Sadducees. There is
probably some exaggeration in the account of Hyrcanus's
persecution of the adherents of the Pharisees,
and of his setting aside all the decrees of the latter.
There is, however, more truth in another report,
from which we learn that Hyrcanus had deposed
the Pharisees from the various high posts they had
filled. The offices belonging to the Temple, to the
courts of law and to the high council were given to
the followers of the Sadducees. But this stroke of
policy produced the saddest results. Naturally
enough it awakened in the hearts of the Pharisees,
and of the people who sided with them, a deep
hatred against the house of the Hasmonæans, which
bore civil war in its train and hastened the nation's
decline. One act had been sufficient to cast a cloud
over the brilliant days of the Hasmonæans.</p>

<p>Hyrcanus lived but a short time after these events.
He died in the thirty-first year of his reign, the
sixtieth year of his age (106), leaving five sons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
Aristobulus, Antigonus, Alexander, Absalom, and
one other, whose name has not come down to us.
Hyrcanus bore some resemblance to his prototype
Solomon, inasmuch as that, after the death of both,
dissensions broke out and the country became a
prey to constant strife and discord.</p>

<p>John Hyrcanus had proclaimed his wife queen, and
his eldest son, Judah, high priest. The latter is
better known by his Greek name Aristobulus, for
he, like his brothers and successors, bore a Greek
as well as a Hebrew name. But it was soon evident
that the Greek custom of placing a female
ruler at the head of the State was not looked upon
with favor in Judæa. Thus Aristobulus was able to
remove his mother from her official position without
creating any disturbance, and he then united in his
own person the two dignities of ruler and high
priest. It is said that he was the first of the Hasmonæans
to assume the royal title; but this title
did not add in any way to his power or his importance.
His coins, indeed, which have since been
discovered, bear only the following inscription,
"The High Priest Judah, and the Commonwealth
of the Judæans," and they are engraved with the
same emblem as those of his father, viz., a cornucopia,
although this symbol of plenty was hardly a
truthful characteristic of the times.</p>

<p>The seed of discord sown by Hyrcanus grew and
spread alarmingly in the reigns of his descendants.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
In vain did the successive rulers attempt to raise
the importance of the royal dignity, in vain did
they surround themselves with a body-guard of
trusty hirelings and perform the most brilliant feats
of valor, the breach between them and their subjects
became irreparable, and no remedy proved
effectual. The royal house and the people were no
longer at one; political life was separated from
religious life, and the two were pursuing opposite
paths.</p>

<p>The king, Aristobulus, not only supplanted his
mother upon the throne, but he also imprisoned her
with three of his brothers. His brother Antigonus
alone, of like temperament to himself and his companion-in-arms,
whom he tenderly loved, was permitted
to take part in the government. In spite of
the meager and unsatisfactory accounts of his short
reign, we may gather from them that he followed
the example of his father's last years, in remaining
closely connected with the Sadducees, and in keeping
the Pharisees from all power and influence.
Aristobulus had but few friends in his own family,
and he does not appear to have been beloved by
his subjects. The fact of his having had a decided
preference for Hellenism accounts for his surname,
which was honored by the Greeks and hated
by the Judæans&mdash;"Friend of the Hellenes." This
one characteristic gave such offense to the people
that they were ready to ascribe to him the authorship
of any evil deed that might occur in the kingdom.
Whilst the Greeks called him fair-minded
and modest, the Judæans accused him of heartlessness
and cruelty. His mother expired during her
imprisonment, possibly of old age; evil report
whispered that her own son was guilty of having
allowed her to die of starvation. His favorite
brother, Antigonus, was foully murdered (probably
through the intrigues of the party hostile to the
Hasmonæans); sharp-tongued calumny affirmed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
that the king, jealous of him, was the author of the
foul deed, and tradition has woven a web of tragic
incidents round the sad fate of Antigonus. But of
this later.</p>

<p>Aristobulus had inherited not only his father's
military ability, but also his plans of extending
Judæa in a northeasterly direction. The Ituræans
and the Trachonites, who often left their mild,
pastoral pursuits for the rougher trade of war,
occupied the district surrounding the gigantic
Mount Hermon, and eastwards as far as the lovely
plain of Damascus. Against these half-barbaric
tribes Aristobulus undertook a campaign, probably
continuing what his father had commenced. His
brother Antigonus, in whose company he had won
his first laurels when fighting against the Samaritans
and the Syrians, was once more his companion-in-arms.
The fortunes of war were favorable to Aristobulus,
as they had been to his father; he acquired
new territory for Judæa, and, like his father, forced
the Judæan religion upon the conquered people.
Continued conquests in the same direction would
have put the caravan roads leading from the land
of the Euphrates to Egypt into the hands of the
Judæans; which possession, combined with the warlike
courage of the inhabitants and the defensive
condition of the fortresses, might have permitted
Judæa to attain an important position among the
nations. But, as though it had been decreed by Providence
that Judæa should not gain influence in such
a manner, Aristobulus was forced by severe illness
to abandon his conquests and to return to Jerusalem.
Antigonus, it is true, carried on the war
successfully for some little time; but after his return
to the capital, for the celebration of the festivals in
the approaching month of Tishri, neither he nor his
royal brother was fated ever again to tread the
arena of war. Antigonus fell, as was mentioned previously,
by the hand of an assassin, and Aristobulus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
died of a malignant disease, after a reign of one
year (106&ndash;105).</p>

<p>The deaths of the two brothers following in close
succession gave evil-tongued calumny the opportunity
of inventing the following fearful tragedy: It
was said that the opponents of Antigonus seized the
occasion of his triumphal return to excite the suffering
king's jealousy. Aristobulus, while still reposing
confidence in his brother, sent for Antigonus,
and intimated that he should appear unarmed. For
greater protection he had his body-guard stationed
in one of the passages, and gave orders that Antigonus
was to be dispatched forthwith if he should
enter armed. The queen, who hated Antigonus,
made use of this order for the destruction of her
brother-in-law, for she persuaded him to go fully
equipped to the king's chamber, and in one of the
dark passages of the tower of Straton the foul deed
was executed. When the king heard that his commands
had been carried out he was violently
affected, and his grief caused a hemorrhage. His
servant, in carrying away a vessel filled with the
blood that he had lost, slipped upon the floor of the
antechamber, still wet with the blood of the assassinated
man, and, dropping the vessel, caused the
blood of the two brothers to mingle. This accident
was said to have had so overpowering an effect
upon the king's mind that he instantly declared
himself to be his brother's murderer, and the agony
of remorse was the final cause of his death. Tradition
adds that an Essene seer of the name of Judah
had not only predicted the violent death of Antigonus,
but also that it would take place in the tower
of Straton.</p>

<p>The commencement of the reign of Aristobulus's
successor is involved in legend. From this we
gather that Alexander, whose Judæan name Jannaï
(Jannæus) is the abbreviation of Jonathan, had not
only been imprisoned by his brother, but had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
so hated by his father that he had been banished to
Galilee. This was the result of a dream, in which
it had been revealed to John Hyrcanus that his third
son would one day be king of Judæa. The widow
of Aristobulus is said to have released him from
prison, and to have given him her hand with the
crown. But in that case Alexander would have
married a widow, which it was unlawful for him, as
high priest, to do. It is more probable that Alexander
ascended the throne, being the nearest heir to
it, without the aid of the widow of Aristobulus.
Nor is there any foundation for the story that
Alexander commenced his reign by the murder of a
brother with whom he had actually shared the
sufferings of his captivity. Alexander appears to
have begun by studying the people's wishes, for the
Pharisees were once more allowed to appear at
court. Simon ben Shetach, the brother of his wife,
Queen Salome, the champion of the Pharisees, was
constantly in the king's presence.</p>

<p>Alexander Jannæus, who came to the throne at
the age of twenty-three, was as warlike as the family
from which he sprung, but he was wanting in the
generalship and the judgment of his ancestors. He
rushed madly into military undertakings, thus weakening
the power of the people, and bringing the
State more than once to the verge of destruction.
The seven and twenty years of his reign were
passed in foreign and civil wars, and were not
calculated to increase the material prosperity of the
nation. His good luck, however, was greater than
his ability, for it enabled him to extricate himself
from many a critical position into which he had
brought himself, and also, upon the whole, to enlarge
the territory of Judæa. Like his father, he employed
mercenaries for his wars, whom he hired from
Pisidia and Cilicia. He did not dare enroll Syrian
troops, the hatred that existed between Judæans
and Syrians being too deeply ingrained to permit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
the harmonious working of the two to be counted
upon.</p>

<p>Alexander's attention was principally directed to
the seaports which had managed to free themselves
from Syrian rule, owing to the rivalry that existed
between the two half-brothers, Antiochus Grypus
and Cyzicenus. He was particularly anxious to
possess himself of the thickly-populated and important
seaport town of Ptolemaïs, colonized by Judæans.
Whilst his troops overran the district of
Gaza, then under the dominion of Zoïlus, a captain
of mercenaries, he pressed the seaport town himself
with a persistent siege. The inhabitants of Ptolemaïs
turned for help to the Egyptian prince Ptolemy
Lathurus, who, at open warfare with his mother, had
seized upon Cyprus. Lathurus, glad to have found
an opportunity of acquiring greater power, and of
being able at the same time to approach the caravan
roads of Egypt, hastened to send thirty thousand
men to the Judæan coast. He chose a Sabbath day
for victoriously driving the Judæan army, consisting
of at least fifty thousand men, from Asochis, near
Sepphoris, back to the Jordan. More than thirty
thousand of Alexander's troops remained on the
field of battle, many were taken prisoners, whilst
the others fled. Lathurus, with part of his army,
marched through Judæa, slaughtering the inhabitants,
without sparing women or children. He
wished not only to revenge himself upon Alexander,
but also upon the Judæans, for had they not been
his enemies in Egypt? Accho likewise surrendered,
and Gaza voluntarily opened its gates to him.</p>

<p>This crushing defeat would doubtless have
brought Judæa into the most revolting slavery, had
not Cleopatra attempted to snatch the fruit of her
son's triumphs from him before he could turn them
against herself. She sent a mighty army against
Lathurus, under the command of two Judæan generals,
Helkias and Ananias, the two sons of Onias,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
to whom she was indebted for the integrity of her
crown. Helkias died during the campaign, and his
brother took his place in the council and in the field.
The position of trust occupied by Ananias was of
distinct advantage to his compatriots in Judæa.
Cleopatra had been urged not to lose the favorable
opportunity, when Judæa was unable to forego her
help, of invading that country and of dethroning
Alexander. But Ananias was indignant at this
advice. He not only pointed out the disgrace of
such faithlessness, but he made the queen understand
the evil consequences that would follow upon
such a step. Many Egyptian Judæans, who were
the upholders of her throne against the threatened
attacks of her son, would make common cause with
her enemies, were she to strike a blow at the independence
of their country. His words even contained
the menace that he would, in such case, not
only withhold his political knowledge and his generalship
from her interests, but that he might possibly
devote them to the cause of her opponents.
This language had its desired effect upon the queen;
she rejected the cunning advice of the enemies of
the Jews, and made an offensive and defensive
league with Alexander at Bethzur (98). Lathurus
was obliged to leave Judæa and to retreat with his
army to Cyprus. All the cities that had resisted
the arms of the Judæan king were now visited by
his wrath.</p>

<p>But he was, above all things, determined upon
retaking Gaza. This object was accomplished only
after a year of desperate fighting, and was finally
brought about by an act of treachery. All the
cruelty inherent in Alexander was poured out upon
the besieged inhabitants of Gaza. He executed
some of the most distinguished amongst them, and
the terror he inspired was so great that many of the
men killed their own wives and children to prevent
them from falling into Judæan slavery (96).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
The nine years of Alexander's reign had been too
prolific in dangerous and perplexing situations to
allow of his disturbing the internal harmony of his
country. He appears to have been strictly neutral
in the strife that was raging between the Pharisees
and Sadducees. His wife Salome may have exercised
her influence in urging him to maintain this
neutral position, as she was a warm partisan of the
once-hated Pharisees.</p>

<p>Alexander appears to have made Simon ben Shetach
the mediator between the two parties; the
Pharisees being still somewhat in the background,
and the Sadducees holding posts of trust. Ever
since John Hyrcanus's secession from Pharisaism, the
Great Council had been composed of Sadducæan
members, and as long as one party was thus openly
preferred to the other, peace and reconciliation
seemed impossible. The king may, therefore, have
been inspired by the wish to bring about some kind
of equality between the two parties by dividing
offices and dignities between them. But the Pharisees
positively refused to act conjointly with their
opponents and offered the most active resistance.
Simon ben Shetach alone allowed himself to be
chosen member of the Council, secretly determining
to purge it by degrees of its Sadducæan element.</p>

<p>Alexander's impartial conduct continued only so
long as the critical position drew his attention away
from home affairs. It changed visibly when he returned
from his campaign, the conqueror of cities
and provinces deeming himself the despotic master
of his people. Either the newly acquired influence
of the Pharisees threatened to be an obstacle in his
path, or he may have wished to reward and attract
the Sadducees upon whom he might rely for carrying
on his campaigns, or he may have been influenced
by his favorite, the Sadducee Diogenes; at
all events, Alexander appeared as the inveterate
opponent of Pharisaic teaching, and made his views<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
public in a most insulting manner. Whilst officiating
as high priest, during the Feast of Tabernacles, it
was his duty, in accordance with an ancient custom,
to pour the contents of a ewer of water upon the
altar as an emblem of fruitfulness. But in order to
show his contempt for a ceremony considered by
the Pharisees as a religious one, Alexander poured
the water at his feet. Nothing more was required
to ignite the wrath of the congregation assembled
in the outer court of the Temple. With reckless
indignation they threw the branches and the fruit,
which they carried in their hands in honor of the
festival, at the heretical king, denouncing him as an
unworthy high priest. Alexander would certainly
have paid for this disgraceful action with his life had
he not called in the help of the Pisidian and Cilician
mercenaries, who had been ordered to be in waiting,
and who fell upon the congregation, slaughtering
6000 within the precincts of the Temple (95). In
order to avoid a repetition of such scenes, Alexander
thenceforth prevented the worshipers from entering
the court of sacrifices, by building up a partition
wall. But these events gave rise to an implacable
hatred between the king and the Pharisees. Thus,
after three generations, the descendants of the great
Hasmonæans had so far weakened the edifice raised
at the expense of their ancestors' lives, that it appears
marvelous how it could have continued to
resist such repeated attacks. The bitter rivalry of
the two kingdoms of Judah and Israel in the days
of Rehoboam and Jeroboam was repeated in the
history of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.</p>

<p>But Alexander did not see the breach that his
hand had childishly and ruthlessly made; absorbed
in magnificent schemes of future conquest he ignored
the fact that if the harmonious intercourse between
the king and his subjects, the very life of the State,
were to cease, greater possessions would but weaken
and not strengthen the kingdom. He had set his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
heart upon invading the trans-Jordanic land, still
called Moabitis, and the southeastern provinces of
the sea of Tiberias, called Galaditis or Gaulonitis.
But his progress in this campaign was checked by
the Nabathæan king Obeda, who lured him into a
pathless country broken up by ravines, where Alexander's
army found its destruction, and where the
king himself escaped only with his life to Jerusalem
(about 94). There the wrath of the Pharisees awaited
him. They had excited the people to revolt, and
six years of bloody uprisings against him were the
consequence (94&ndash;89). Alexander succeeded in putting
down one revolt after another by the aid of his
mercenaries, but the horrible butcheries that took
place on these occasions were a perpetual incentive
to fresh uprisings. Alexander, worn out at length by
these sanguinary proceedings, offered to make peace
with the Pharisees. It was now, however, their turn
to reject the proffered hand of peace, and to be guilty
of an act of treachery towards their country which
must remain as an indelible stain upon their party.
Upon Alexander's question as to what conditions of
peace they required, the Pharisaic leaders answered
that the first condition was the death of the king.
They had, in fact, secretly offered their aid to the
Syrian monarch Eucærus to humble Alexander.
Summoned by their promises, Eucærus advanced
upon Judæa with 40,000 infantry and 3000 cavalry.
Upon the news of this impending danger, Alexander
marched out at the head of 20,000 infantry and
1000 cavalry. In the terrible encounter that ensued
at Shechem, Judæan fought against Judæan, Greek
against Greek, for each army remained true to its
leader and could not be bribed into desertion. The
battle, disastrous for both sides, was finally gained
by Eucærus, and Alexander was driven, through the
loss of his mercenaries, to wander among the mountain-passes
of Ephraim. There, his solitary position
moved his people to pity, and six thousand of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
Pharisaic opponents left the Syrian camp and went
over to their king, who was now able to force
Eucærus's retreat from Judæa.</p>

<p>But the more relentless amongst the Pharisees
still held out against Alexander, and after an unsuccessful
battle in the open field, threw themselves for
safety into the fortress of Bethome, which, however,
they were obliged to surrender. Urged by his
Sadducæan favorite Diogenes, and impelled by his
own thirst for revenge, the king had eight hundred
Pharisees crucified in one day. Tradition even
relates that the wives and children of the victims
were butchered before their eyes, and that Alexander,
surrounded by his minions, feasted in the presence
of this scene of carnage. But this exaggeration
of cruelty was not required to brand him with the
name of "Thracian"; the crucifixion of eight hundred
men was enough to stigmatize him as a heartless
butcher, and this action alone was to bring forth
bitter fruits for the Sadducees who had witnessed it
with malicious joy. During the civil wars that had
lasted for six years, fifty thousand men of both parties
had been sacrificed, but the Pharisees had
suffered most. The remaining Pharisees trembled
for their lives, and the night after the crucifixion of
the eight hundred, eight thousand fled from Judæa,
part of them to Syria and part to Egypt.</p>

<p>The weakness of Alexander's position may readily
be gauged by the fact of his powerlessness to
prevent Judæa from being made the seat of war by
the kings of Nabathæa and Syria. Yet his good
fortune did not forsake him, for a sudden change in
the affairs of Syria, resulting in the overthrow of its
king, Aretas, worked to Alexander's advantage.
Thereby he was enabled to engage in the siege of
some important towns, colonized by Greeks and
subject to Aretas: Diospolis, Pella and Gerasa.
Marching north, he invaded the lower Gaulonitis,
with its capital, Gamala, the upper province, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
town of Sogane, and the city of Seleucia. He forced
the inhabitants of these towns to accept Judaism and
the sign of the covenant. The city of Pella, making
a show of resistance, was destroyed. He also recovered
the cities lying east of the Red Sea, which had
been taken from him by Aretas. The territory of
Judæa now embraced within its circumference a number
of important towns; it extended on the other
side of the Jordan, from Seleucia in the north to
Zoar, the city of palms, south of the Dead Sea; from
Rhinokolura and Raphia in the south, on the shores
of the Mediterranean, to the mountains of Carmel
in the northwest. The cities on the sea-coast were
of the most importance. Alexander ordered some
coins to be struck for his Greek subjects, with the
Greek inscription, "<span class="smcap">King Alexander</span>," while an
anchor was stamped upon one side, and upon the
other, in Hebrew characters, "<span class="smcap">Jonathan the King</span>"
(Jehonathan ha-Melech). His coins of an earlier
date bore the same inscription as those of his predecessors,
"<span class="smcap">The High Priest Jonathan, the Commonwealth
of the Judæans</span>."</p>

<p>After a campaign of three years' duration Alexander
returned to Jerusalem, where he was received
with the honors due to a conqueror. He had caused
his crimes in part to be forgiven. In the very center
of the kingdom, on a mount near the Jordan, he
built a strong fortress, called after him, <span class="smcap">Alexandrion</span>;
and in the neighborhood of the Dead Sea,
upon a towering height, protected on all sides by
deep ravines, he raised the citadel of Machærus, the
formidable guardian of his trans-Jordanic conquests.
These two mountain fortresses, together with the
third, Hyrcanion, built by John Hyrcanus, on Middle
Mountain, were so amply fortified by nature and by
art that they were considered impregnable.</p>

<p>Even in the last years of Alexander's reign,
although he was suffering from an intermittent
fever, he undertook the siege of some of the yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
unconquered fortresses of the trans-Jordanic territory.
During the siege of Argob, however, he
was seized with so severe an attack that he was
forced to prepare himself for death. The solemnity
of his last hours led him to look upon
his former actions in a new light. He was horror-stricken
to think how cruelly and foolishly he had
persecuted the Pharisees, and how in consequence
he had alienated himself from his people. He earnestly
enjoined upon his queen, whom he declared
regent, to connect herself closely with the Pharisees,
to surround herself with counselors from their ranks,
and not to embark in any undertaking without having
their consent. He also impressed upon her to
keep his death secret from his army until the beleaguered
fortress should have fallen, and then to resign
his body to the Pharisees, that they might either
vent their rage upon it or else generously inter it.
From an obscure but more authentic source we
gather that Alexander sought to allay the queen's
anxiety with regard to the party strife rampant in
Jerusalem by the following words: "Do not fear
either the true Pharisees or their honest opponents,
but be on your guard against hypocrites of both
sides (the counterfeit ones), who, when they commit
sins, like the dissolute Prince Zimri, expect to be
rewarded like Phineas, who was zealous for the Law."
Alexander died in the forty-ninth year of his life and
the twenty-seventh of his reign (79), and left two
sons, Hyrcanus and Aristobulus. The Pharisees
ungenerously appointed the anniversary of his death
as a day of rejoicing.</p>

<p>It was indeed most fortunate for the Judæan
nation that a woman of gentle nature and sincere
piety should have been called to the head of the
State after it had been torn asunder by the recklessness
of its former ruler. She came like the refreshing
dew to an arid and sunburnt soil. The excited
passions and the bitter hatred of the two parties had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
time to abate during her reign, and the country rose
above narrow partisanship to the worthier occupation
of advancing the common welfare of the nation.
Although Queen Salome, or, as she was called,
Alexandra, was devoted with her whole soul to the
Pharisees, entrusting them with the management of
home affairs, yet she was far from persecuting the
opposing party. Her authority was so greatly respected
by the neighboring princes that they did
not dare make war with Judæa, and she shrewdly
succeeded in keeping a mighty conqueror, who had
possessed himself of Syria, from the confines of her
own kingdom. Even the heavens, during the nine
years of her reign, showered their blessings upon
the land. The extraordinarily large grains of wheat
gathered during this time in the fields of Judæa were
kept and exhibited during many subsequent years.
The queen ordered coins to be struck, bearing the
same emblems as her predecessors, with the Greek
inscription, "<span class="smcap">Queen Alexandra</span>." On the whole,
her reign passed peacefully and happily. The Law,
which had fallen into great neglect, became a fixed
institution, and if it occasionally affected the Sadducees,
who were constantly breaking it, they could
not consider themselves victims of caprice. The
crowded prisons were opened; the Pharisees returned
from exile, with their narrowed vision widened
by the experience they had gained in foreign lands.</p>

<p>Salome Alexandra proclaimed her eldest son
Hyrcanus high priest; he was a weak prince, whose
private life was irreproachable, but who was not
fitted for a public post of importance.</p>

<p>Simon ben Shetach, the brother of the queen, the
oracle of the Pharisaic party, stood high in her favor.
So great a part did he play in the history of that
time that it was called by many "the days of Simon
ben Shetach and of Queen Salome." The chief post
in the Council of Seventy, hitherto possessed by the
high priest, was now, however, given up to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
Pharisees by order of the queen. The Nasi, or
president of the Great Council, was from this time
on, as a rule, the most learned and the most respected
of the Pharisees. No one, of course, could
lay juster claim to this distinction than Simon ben
Shetach. But Simon was not an ambitious man,
and he determined to waive his own rights of precedence
in favor of Judah ben Tabbai, who was then
residing in Alexandria, of whose profound learning
and excellent character he had formed a high estimate.
The Alexandrian Judæan community had
probably entrusted this celebrated Palestinean scholar
with some important office. A flattering epistle was
sent to Judah, inviting him to return to Jerusalem
and was couched in this form: "From me, Jerusalem,
the holy city, to thee, Alexandria: my spouse dwells
with thee, I am forsaken." Judah ben Tabbai responded
to this appeal by hastening to Jerusalem.
With the help of Simon he undertook the reorganization
of the Council, the improvement of administration
of the law, the re-establishment of neglected
religious observances, the furthering of education,
and generally the fashioning of such regulations
as the times required. Like Ezra and Nehemiah
of old, these two zealous men insisted upon a return
to the strictest form of Judaism; and, if they were
often obliged to employ severe and violent measures,
these are not to be accounted to any personal
malice, but to the sternness of the age itself. They
were indeed scrupulously strict in their own conduct,
and in directing those closely connected with them.
From the days of Judah ben Tabbai and Simon ben
Shetach, the rule of Judæan Law, according to the
views of the Pharisees, may be said to have begun, and
it grew and developed under each succeeding generation.
These two celebrated men have therefore
been called "Restorers of the Law," who "brought
back to the Crown (the Law) its ancient splendor."</p>

<p>Their work commenced with the reorganization<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
of the Synhedrion. The Sadducæan members were
deprived of their seats, the penal code which
they had added to the Biblical penal laws was set
aside, and the old traditionary methods again made
valid. The people had nothing to complain of in
this change, for they hated the severity of the "eye
for eye" punishment of the Sadducees. On the
other hand, certain days of rejoicing, disregarded
by the Sadducees, were proclaimed as half-holidays
by the Pharisees. Witnesses in the law courts
were no longer to be questioned merely upon the
place where and the time when they had seen a
crime committed, but they were expected to give
the most detailed and minute evidence connected
with it, so that the judge might be better able to
pronounce a correct judgment and to detect the
contradictory statements of witnesses. This was
particularly designed as a protection against the
charges of informers, who were numerous enough
in an age when conquerors and the conquered were
constantly changing parts. A salutary measure
also was enforced to lessen the number of divorce
cases, which the literal interpretation of the Pentateuchal
divorce laws, as administered by the Sadducees,
had failed in doing. The High Court, as reorganized
by the Pharisees, ordered the husband to
give his repudiated wife a certain sum of money,
by which she could support herself, and, as there
was but little current coin amongst a people whose
wealth consisted principally in the fruits of the soil
or in cattle, the husband would often pause before
allowing a momentary fit of passion or excitement
to influence his actions.</p>

<p>One of the reforms of this time expressly attributed
to Simon ben Shetach was the promotion of better
instruction. In all large towns, high schools for the
use of young men from the age of sixteen sprung
up at his instance. But all study, we may presume,
was entirely confined to the Holy Scriptures, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
particularly to the Pentateuch and the study of the
Law. Many details or smaller points in the Law
which had been partly forgotten and partly neglected
during the long rule of the Sadducees, that is to say,
from Hyrcanus's oppression of the Pharisees until
the commencement of Salome's reign, were once
more introduced into daily life. Neglected customs
were renewed with all pomp and solemnity, the
days of their re-introduction being celebrated with
rejoicing, and any public mourning or fast thereon
was suspended. Thus the ceremony of pouring
a libation of water upon the altar during the Feast
of Tabernacles, which had been mockingly ridiculed
by Alexander, was in time reinstated with enthusiasm,
and became a favorite and distinctive rite. Upon
these occasions, on the night succeeding the first
day of the festival, the women's outer court of the
Temple was brilliantly illuminated until it glowed
like a sea of fire. All the people would then
crowd to the holy mount to witness or take part
in the proceedings. At times these bore a lively
character, such as torch-light processions and dancing;
at others they took the more solemn form of
musical services of song and praise. This jubilee
would last the whole night. At break of day the
priests announced with a blast of their trumpets
that the march was about to commence. At every
halting-place the trumpets gathered the people
together, until a huge multitude stood assembled
round the spring of Siloah. Thence the water was
drawn in a golden ewer. In solemn procession it
was carried back to the Temple, where the libation
was performed. The water streamed over the
altar, and the notes of the flute, heard only upon
the most joyful occasions, mingled with the rapturous
strains of melody that burst from countless instruments.</p>

<p>A similar national festival was the half-holiday of
the wood-feast, held in honor of the wood that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
offered to the altar of the Temple; it fell upon the
fifteenth day of Ab (August). A number of white-robed
maidens were wont to assemble upon this
occasion in some open space among the vine-trees,
where, as they trod the measure of the dance, they
chanted strophes of song in the Hebrew tongue.
It was an opportunity for the Judæan youths, spectators
of this scene, to select their partners for life.
This festival, like the preceding one, was inaugurated
by the Pharisees in opposition to Sadducæan customs.
The Synhedrion seized upon the sacrificial ardor of
the people to introduce a measure which, above all
things, was calculated to arouse feelings of patriotism
in the nation, and which was diametrically opposed
to the views of their rivals. The Sadducees had
declared that the daily offerings, and in fact the
needs of the Temple, should not be paid for
from a national treasury, but with individual, voluntary
contributions. But the Council, in the reign
of Salome Alexandra, decreed that every Israelite
from the age of twenty&mdash;proselytes and freed slaves
included&mdash;should contribute at least a half-shekel
yearly to the treasury of the Temple. In this way
the daily sacrifices acquired a truly national character,
as the whole nation contributed towards them.
Three collections were instituted during the year:
in Judæa at the beginning of spring; in the trans-Jordanic
countries, in Egypt and Syria, at the
Feast of Weeks; and in the yet more distant lands
of Babylonia, Media and Asia Minor, at the Feast
of Tabernacles. These last collections were the
richest, the Judæans who dwelt outside Palestine
being very generous as well as very wealthy; thus,
instead of the silver or copper shekel or denaria,
they offered gold staters and darics. Central places
in each land were chosen where the offerings should
be deposited until they could be taken to Jerusalem.
The most distinguished Judæans were selected to
carry them thither, and they were called "holy messengers."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
In the Mesopotamian and Babylonian
towns of Nisibis and Nahardea (Naarda), treasure-houses
were built for these Temple gifts, whence,
under a strong escort to protect them from the
Parthian and Nabathæan robber-hordes, they were
safely borne to Jerusalem. The communities of
Asia Minor had likewise their treasure-houses,
Apamea and Laodicea, in Phrygia, Pergamus and
Adramyttium, in the country of Aeolis. From
this stretch of land nearly two hundred pounds
weight of gold was sent to Jerusalem about twenty
years after the first proclamation had been issued.
From this we may gather what an immense revenue
poured into the Temple, leaving a large surplus
after all the requisites for divine service had
been obtained. The Temple of Jerusalem became
thereby in time an object of envy and of greed.</p>

<p>So far, the revival, introduced by Judah ben
Tabbai and Simon ben Shetach, bore a harmless
character; it reinstated old laws, created new ones,
and sought means of impressing them upon the
memory and attention of the people. But no reaction
can remain within moderate bounds; it
moves naturally towards excesses. The Sadducees,
who were unwilling to adopt the Pharisaic rendering
of the Law, were summoned to appear before the
seat of justice and were unsparingly condemned.
The anxiety to exalt the Law and to banish all
opposition in the rival party was so great that upon
one occasion Judah ben Tabbai had a witness
executed who had been convicted of giving false
testimony in a trial for a capital crime. He was,
in this instance, desirous of practically refuting the
Sadducæan views, forgetting that he was at the
same time breaking a law of the Pharisees. That
law required all the witnesses to be convicted of
perjury before allowing punishment to be inflicted;
and, as one witness alone could not establish an
accusation, so one witness alone was not punishable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
But the two chiefs were so clean-handed that Simon
ben Shetach did not fail to upbraid his colleague
on account of ill-advised haste, and Judah ben Tabbai
evinced the profoundest remorse at the shedding
of the innocent blood of the executed witness by
resigning his office of president and by making
a public acknowledgment of his contrition. A
favorite maxim of Judah ben Tabbai reveals his
gentle disposition. "Consider accused persons as
lawbreakers only whilst before you for judgment;
the moment that is rendered, look upon them as
innocent."</p>

<p>Simon ben Shetach, who succeeded Judah as
President of the Council, does not seem to have
relaxed in severity towards the infringers of the
Law. The rare case of witchcraft was once brought
before him, when eighty women were condemned
for the offense, and crucified in Ascalon. On account
of his unsparing severity, Simon ben Shetach
brought upon himself such hatred of his opponents
that they determined upon a fearful revenge. They
incited two false witnesses to accuse his son of a
crime punishable with death, in consequence of
which he was actually condemned to die. On his
way to the place of execution the young man
uttered such vehement protestations of innocence
that at last the witnesses themselves were affected,
and confessed to their tissue of falsehoods. But
when the judges were about to set free the condemned,
the prisoner himself drew their attention
to their violation of the law, which enjoined that no
belief was to be given witnesses who withdrew their
previous testimony. "If you wish," said the condemned
youth to his father, "that the salvation of
Israel should be wrought by your hand, consider me
but the threshold over which you must pass without
compunction." Both father and son showed themselves
worthy of their sublime task, that of guarding
the integrity of the Law; for to uphold it one sacrificed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
his life, and the other, his paternal love. Simon,
the Judæan Brutus, let the law pursue its course,
although he, as well as all the judges, were convinced
of his son's innocence.</p>

<p>The severity of the Pharisaic Synhedrion had
naturally not spared the leaders of the Sadducees.
Diogenes, the favorite of Alexander, and a number
of others who had advised or authorized the execution
of the 800 Pharisees, expiated this act of cruelty
with their lives. The most distinguished of the
Sadducees began to be uneasy at this constant persecution;
they felt the sword of justice hanging over
their heads, ready to descend upon them if they were
guilty of the slightest infringement of the Law. In
fear of their lives they turned to Alexander's second
son, Aristobulus, who, without being a warm adherent
of the Sadducees, was prepared to be the protector
of their party. He sent their chiefs to Alexandra,
commending them warmly to her mercy.
When they appeared before the queen they reminded
her of their services to the late king, and of the
terror with which their name had once inspired
Judæa's neighbors, and they threatened to offer their
valuable services to the Nabathæan king Aretas or
to the Syrian monarch. They implored the queen
to grant them a safe retreat in some fortress where
they would not be under the constant supervision of
the Pharisees. The gentle-hearted queen was so
much moved by the tears of these gray-haired warriors
that she entrusted them with the command of
most of the fortresses, reserving, however, the three
strongest&mdash;Hyrcanion, Alexandrion, and Machærus.</p>

<p>No political events of any great importance
occurred during Alexandra's reign. Tigranes, king
of Armenia, master of nearly the whole of Syria, had
threatened to invade some of the Judæan provinces
which had formerly belonged to the Syrian kingdom.
The proximity of this ruler had greatly alarmed the
queen, and she endeavored by gentle words and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
rich presents to prevent a contest with this powerful
Armenian king. Tigranes had received the
Judæan embassy, and accepted the queen's gifts
most courteously, but they would hardly have prevented
him from moving upon Judæa, had he not
been compelled to devote himself to the defense of
his own country from the attack of the Roman commander
Lucullus (69).</p>

<p>Alexandra fell hopelessly ill, and her illness occasioned
the saddest of entanglements. The violent
and ambitious Aristobulus, supposing that his
mother destined his weak brother Hyrcanus as her
successor, left the capital secretly, and arriving at the
Galilean fortress of Gabata in the neighborhood of
Sepphoris, upon the friendship of whose governor,
the Sadducee Galaistes, he could rely, insisted upon
its being entirely given up to him. He garrisoned
it with mercenaries, furnished by some of the minor
Syrian trans-Jordanic princes and the robber-hordes
of Trachonitis, and was thus enabled to hold a large
force at his command. Hyrcanus and the chiefs of
the Synhedrion, fearing an impending civil war,
entreated of the queen to take measures to prevent
it, but without avail. Alexandra bade them trust to
the army, to the fortresses that had remained faithful,
and to the rich treasury, and devoted herself
exclusively to preparation for death. She expired
soon after, in the year 69, leaving her people
and her kingdom to all the horrors of a civil war
which was ultimately to destroy their dearly won
independence. Salome Alexandra had reigned for
only nine years; she had witnessed the happy days
of her people's freedom, and, when lying on her
death-bed, may have felt in her troubled soul the
presentiment that the coming night of slavery was
at hand. She was the only queen in Judæan history
whose name has been handed down to us with veneration,
and she was also the last independent ruler
of Judæa.</p>

<p class="center bpad">69&ndash;40 <span class="smcap smaller">B.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;E.</span></p>

<p>When Providence has decreed that a State shall be
destroyed, no event is more certain to hasten its
fall than the contentions between two rival parties
for the possession of the throne. The noblest
upholders of the nation's rights are then invariably
arrayed against each other, until at last the civil
wars in which they are engaged are usually referred
to some foreign ruler, whose yoke is all the more
galling as he appears invariably in the light of a
peacemaker with the olive branch in his hand.</p>

<p>The death of the queen gave the first incentive to
the war which broke out between the two brothers
and divided the nation into two camps. To Hyrcanus
II, her eldest son, the dying mother had, in
right of his birth, bequeathed the throne. He,
whose virtues would have graced the modest life of
a private individual, but who would have been but
an indifferent ruler even in a peaceful era, was certainly
not fitted to govern in troubled times. He
did more harm by his good nature than many
another could do by acts of tyranny. His younger
brother was the direct opposite to him in character.
Hyrcanus's cowardice contrasted vividly with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
reckless courage of Aristobulus, a quality in which
he resembled his father Alexander. Added to this,
he possessed unlimited ambition, which blinded him
to practical considerations and quitted him only
with his last breath. His aim was to be the mighty
ruler of Judæa, and with the means at his command
to make the neighboring countries subject to his
rule. But his rash impetuosity prevented him from
being successful, and, instead of gathering laurels,
he brought only contempt upon himself and his
nation. Hardly had Alexandra expired when
Aristobulus, at the head of his mercenaries and
Sadducæan followers, marched upon Jerusalem for
the purpose of dethroning his brother. Upon Hyrcanus's
side were ranged the Pharisees, the people
and the army. The wife and children of Aristobulus
had been imprisoned as hostages in the citadel
of Baris in Jerusalem. The brothers met at Jericho,
each at the head of his army. Hyrcanus was defeated
and fled to Jerusalem, the greater number
of his troops going over to Aristobulus. The
younger brother attacked and took the Temple,
where many of his opponents had sought refuge.
Hyrcanus was obliged to lay down his arms when
he saw that the invader was master of the sanctuary
and the capital. The two brothers met again,
agreed upon making peace, and signed their covenant
in the Temple. Aristobulus, as the one more
capable of ruling, was to wear the royal crown,
whilst Hyrcanus was to retain the high priest's
diadem. This agreement was ratified by the marriage
of Aristobulus's son Alexander to Alexandra,
daughter of Hyrcanus.</p>

<p>Aristobulus II, who had attained royal dignity by
a successful stroke of arms, does not appear to have
in any way excited the displeasure of the Pharisees.
The position of the two parties in Judæa now
assumed a different character, and they might have
become extinct as parties, had it not been for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
advent of a man whose measureless ambition and
personal interest brought him to the fore, and who,
together with his family, became the vampire of the
nation, sucking its noblest blood away. This man
was Antipater, the descendant of a distinguished
Idumæan family, who, in common with all other
Idumæans, had been compelled by John Hyrcanus
to accept Judaism. Never had a mistaken action
found its punishment more surely and swiftly. The
fanaticism of Hyrcanus I was now to bring ruin
upon his house and family. The wealth and diplomatic
talents of Antipater had raised him to the
post of satrap of Idumæa during the reign of Alexander
Jannæus and of his queen. His courteous
acts and generous presents had won the affections
not only of his countrymen, but also those of the
inhabitants of Gaza and Ascalon.</p>

<p>Hyrcanus II, who required a guide in his helplessness,
bestowed his confidence upon Antipater, who
abused it, and exerted his influence to his own
advantage. The Idumæan lost no opportunity of
reminding Hyrcanus of the degrading part that he had
had to play in having been called to the throne only
to relinquish it to his younger brother. So successfully
did Antipater work upon his feelings, making
him believe that Aristobulus was actually planning his
death, that Hyrcanus was tempted into breaking the
covenant he had sworn to respect, by calling in a
foreign ruler to decide between the claims of the two
brothers. Antipater had laid his plans beforehand
with Aretas, king of the Nabathæans. He fled one
night from Jerusalem, bearing Hyrcanus with him,
and arrived by forced marches at Petra, the capital
of the Nabathæan king. Aretas was ready to help
Hyrcanus, having been richly bribed by Antipater,
and having the prospect of recapturing twelve cities
east and south of the Dead Sea, which had been
bought so dearly by the Hasmonæans. He marched,
therefore, upon Judæa, with an army of fifty thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
men, whose numbers were augmented by the followers
of Hyrcanus (66). Thus the peace which
the nation had enjoyed for nearly three years was
disturbed for many a long day by the scheming
ambition of Antipater and the boundless folly of
Hyrcanus.</p>

<p>Aretas laid siege to Jerusalem in the beginning
of the spring. To escape so deplorable a sight,
many of the most distinguished Judæans (probably
some of the Pharisaic leaders amongst them) fled
from the capital to Egypt. The siege lasted for
several months, the strong walls of the city to a
certain extent making up for the insufficient numbers
of Aristobulus's warriors. But provisions began
to fail, and, what was a far more serious consideration
for the pious Judæans, the animals necessary
for sacrificial purposes, particularly for the coming
Paschal feast, were sensibly diminishing. But Aristobulus
relied, and rightly so, upon the piety of the
Judæan besiegers, who would not dare refuse the
required victims for the altar. He ordered baskets
to be lowered each day from the walls, containing the
price of the lambs that were placed in the baskets,
and were drawn up in return. But as the siege
dragged on, and as the end seemed far off, some
counselor&mdash;we may imagine that it was Antipater&mdash;advised
Hyrcanus to hurry on the final scene, and
to desist from supplying the sacrificial lamb. The
basket that was lowered after this advice had been
tendered was found to contain, when received within
the city walls, a pig. This insult to the Law created
a feeling of disgust amongst the besieged, and so
deeply affected them that subsequently the breeding
of swine was forbidden by the Synhedrion.</p>

<p>The adherents of Hyrcanus were guilty of yet
another enormity. Amongst those who had left the
besieged city was a pious man called Onias, who
had once successfully prayed for rain in a drought.
The soldiers of Hyrcanus dragged him from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
solitary retreat, and believing that Heaven would
again answer his prayer, commanded him to pronounce
a curse upon Aristobulus and his followers.
But instead of giving vent to a curse, the old man exclaimed
with fitting dignity, "Lord of the universe,
as the besieged and the besiegers both belong to
Thy people, I entreat of Thee not to grant the evil
prayers of either party." The coarse soldiers could
not understand the feelings that prompted such
words, and murdered him as if he had been a criminal.
In this way they thought they could silence
the spirit of Judaism rising to protest against this
civil war. But although the mighty ones of the land
defied all right and proper feeling, the people were
grievously distressed, and believed that the earthquake
and the hurricane that devastated Palestine
and other parts of Asia at that time were the
visible signs of Divine wrath.</p>

<p>But more terrible than earthquake or hurricane
was the harbinger of evil that appeared in Judæa,
"the beast with iron teeth, brazen claws, and heart
of stone, that was to devour much, and trample the
rest under foot," which came to the Judæan nation,
to drink its blood, to eat its flesh and to suck
its marrow. The hour had struck when the Roman
eagle, with swift flight, was to swoop down upon
Israel's inheritance, circling wildly round the bleeding
nation, lacerating her with cruel wounds and
finally leaving her a corpse.</p>

<p>Like inexorable fate, Rome watched over the
destinies of the people of western Asia, plundering,
dividing and destroying. Judæa was destined to
the same lot. The bird of prey scented its booty
from afar with astonishing precision, and hastened
to put out the last spark of life. It came to Judæa
for the first time in the person of Scaurus, a legate
of Pompey. In leaving for Asia, Scaurus hoped to
exchange an insignificant position in his own country
for a powerful one in foreign lands. He had imagined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
that in Syria he might acquire wealth and honor,
but finding that country already in possession of
other birds of prey, he turned his attention to Judæa.
There he was warmly welcomed by the rival brothers,
who looked upon him as an arbitrator in their difficulties.
They both sent ambassadors to meet him,
and as they knew that the Romans were not indifferent
to gold, they took care not to appear empty-handed
before him. But Aristobulus's gifts prevailed;
he sent three hundred talents, whilst Hyrcanus,
or more properly speaking Antipater, gave
little but promises. Roman interest accorded well
with the greed of Scaurus. The Republic, fearing
the growth of his power, began by insisting that the
Nabathæan king should retire from the civil war
in Palestine; Scaurus was therefore able to command
Aretas to raise the siege of Jerusalem. Aretas
complied, but was overtaken with his army at Rabbath
Ammon by the troops of Aristobulus and defeated.</p>

<p>For the moment Aristobulus might fancy that he
was the victorious monarch of Judæa. The direction
that Roman statesmanship had taken, and the
slow, deliberate movements that the commander
Pompey employed against Mithridates, lulled him
into the delusion that his monarchy was one of lasting
duration. A lover of war like his father, he
began immediately to make inroads into neighboring
provinces, and also organized a fleet for warlike
purposes. For two years Aristobulus nursed this
vain dream, and he may even have wished to establish
a show of independence by ordering, during this
interval, coins to be struck in his name. But Antipater's
inventive genius soon dissipated this dream;
for in the arts of bribery and diplomacy he was far
superior to Aristobulus. Antipater had already induced
Scaurus to side with Hyrcanus, and to win for
him the favor of Pompey, who was at this time
gathering laurels in Syria. Pompey looked upon
the quarrel between the two brothers as an excellent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
means for adding another conquest to his long
lists of triumphs. Although Aristobulus had made
him a magnificent gift, valuable in point of art as
of intrinsic merit, the contest had not been brought
to an end. This gift consisted of a golden vine,
bearing clusters of golden grapes and golden
leaves, valued at five hundred talents, and it had
probably been designed by King Alexander for the
adornment of the Temple. This work of art aroused
the admiration of all those who saw it, and for that
reason Pompey hastened to send it to Rome, where
it was placed in the Temple of Jupiter on the Capitol,
as the harbinger of his triumphs. But the pious
Judæans, naturally, would not allow their own sanctuary
to be deprived of such an ornament, and
spontaneously made contributions, some for golden
grapes, others for golden leaves; so that another
golden vine, in later days, graced the outer court of
the Temple.</p>

<p>Although Pompey's vanity was flattered by this
magnificent present, he was far from deciding in
favor of the donor. He had the insolence to command
Antipater and Nicodemus, the two envoys of
the rival brothers, to bid their masters appear in
person at Damascus, where the vexed question
should be discussed, and where he would decide in
favor of one of the two princes. In spite of the
deep humiliation which each felt, both Hyrcanus
and Aristobulus appeared, and upheld their individual
claims; the one resting upon his rights
of birth, the other upon his capacity for governing.
But a third party had also appeared before
Pompey, which was to represent the right of
the nation apart from the angry princes. Weary
of the Hasmonæan quarrels, a republican party
had sprung up, which was ready to govern the
Judæan community, according to the letter of the
Law, without an hereditary sovereign. The republicans
especially complained that the last of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
Hasmonæans had changed the Judæan form of
government from a hierarchy to a monarchy, in
order to reduce the nation to servitude. Pompey,
however, gave ear neither to the murmurs of the
republicans nor to the arguments of the two
brothers. It was not his intention to put an end
to the strife; what he desired was, in the guise of a
peaceful arbitrator, to bring Judæa under the Roman
rule. He soon saw that the weak-minded Hyrcanus
(under the tutelage of a designing minister) would
be better adapted for the part of a ward of Rome
than the daring Aristobulus, and he inwardly determined
to support the weaker prince. But as he
feared that by too rash a decision he would only be
involved in a long contest with Aristobulus in an
inaccessible country, and that he would only delay
his triumphal entry into Rome, he endeavored to
put off the younger brother with empty promises.
Aristobulus, however, saw through the snare that
was prepared for him, and determined to make sure
of his freedom whilst there was yet time. He,
therefore, entrenched himself in the citadel of Alexandrion,
intending to oppose the invasion of the
enemy from the walls of the fortress. But Roman
greed of conquest was now to manifest itself in
all its abhorrent nakedness.</p>

<p>The Roman commander was pleased to look
upon this prince's justifiable act of self-defense as
evidence of insubordination, and to treat him as an
obstinate rebel. He crossed the Jordan at Bethshean,
and taking the field against Aristobulus, commanded
him to surrender, following up this command
by a series of delusive promises and serious
threats, such as would have induced a more wily
man to take a false step. The unfortunate prince
surrendered the fortress of Alexandrion, but soon
repenting of this folly, returned to entrench himself
behind the strong walls of the city of Jerusalem,
whither Pompey followed him. When the Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
commander arrived at Jericho he heard, to his
infinite satisfaction, of the suicide of Mithridates, the
great and dangerous enemy of the Roman State,
and he felt that he had now only to subdue Aristobulus
before celebrating his triumphs in Rome.
It seemed as if this end would be easily attained;
for Aristobulus, impelled by fear, came penitently
to the feet of Pompey, loading him with presents,
and promising to deliver Jerusalem into his hands.
For this purpose Aristobulus started for the capital,
accompanied by the legate Gabinius; but their
advance was repelled by the patriots, who closed
the gates of Jerusalem upon them, and Pompey was
compelled to lead his army against the city. The
Hyrcanists, or lovers of peace, as they were called,
opened their gates to the enemy; but the patriots
entrenched themselves upon the Mount of the
Sanctuary, and destroying the bridge that connected
the Temple with the town, prepared for a desperate
defense. Pompey, much against his will, found that
he was involved in a regular siege, the Temple
Mount being strongly fortified. Then he sent to
Tyre for his battering-rams, and ordered trees to be
felled for bridging over the moats. The siege
lasted for a long while, and might have continued
still longer, had not the storming of the fortress
been rendered easier to the besiegers by the
patriots' strict observance of the Sabbath-day. In
accordance with either a Pharisaic or a Sadducæan
rendering of the Law, the besieged declared that
they were permitted to resist an attack of the
invaders on the Sabbath, but that they were
infringing upon the sanctity of that day if they
merely defended the walls from the enemy's onslaughts.
As soon as the Romans were aware of
this distinction, they turned it to their own advantage.
They let their weapons rest on the Sabbath-day,
and worked steadily at the demolishing of the
walls. Thus it happened that upon one Sabbath, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
the month of Sivan (June, 63 <span class="smcap smaller">B.&nbsp;C.</span>), a tower of the
Temple fell, and a breach was effected by which
the most daring of the Romans prepared a way for
entering the Sanctuary. The legions of Rome and
the foreign mercenaries crowded into the court of
the Temple, and killed the priests as they stood
sacrificing before the altar. Many of the unfortunate
victims threw themselves headlong from the
battlements into the depths below, whilst others lit
their own funeral pyre. It is believed that twelve
thousand Judæans met their death upon this day.
Pompey then penetrated into the Sanctuary, in
order to satisfy his curiosity as to the nature of
the Judæan worship, about which the most contradictory
reports prevailed. The Roman general was
not a little astonished at finding within the sacred
recesses of the Holy of Holies, neither an ass's
head nor, indeed, images of any sort. Thus the
malicious fictions busily circulated by Alexandrian
writers, and of a character so prejudicial to the
Judæans, were now shown to be false. The entrance
of the Roman conqueror into the Temple,
though deplorable enough, was in a way favorable to
Judaism. Whether he was penetrated by awe at
the sublime simplicity of the Holy of Holies, or
whether he did not wish to be designated as the
robber of sanctuaries, we know not; but, wonderful
to relate, Pompey controlled his greed for gold
and left the treasury, containing 2000 talents, untouched.
But the independence of the nation
ceased forever from that hour. Exactly a century
after the Maccabees had freed their people from the
tyranny of the Syrians, their descendants brought
down the tyranny of the Romans upon Judæa.</p>

<p>What did Hyrcanus gain by his supplication for
aid from the Republic? Pompey deprived him of
his royal title, only leaving him the dignity of the
high priesthood, with the doubtful appellation of
ethnarch, and made him the ward of Antipater, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
was named governor of the country. The walls of
Jerusalem were razed to the ground, Judæa put
into the category of conquered provinces, and a tax
was levied upon the capital. The territory was
brought within narrower confines, and its extent
became once more what it had been in pre-Hasmonæan
times. Several seaports lying along the
coast, and inhabited by Greeks, as well as those
trans-Jordanic towns which Hyrcanus and Alexander
had conquered after hard fighting, and had
incorporated with Judæa, were declared to be free
towns by Pompey, and were placed under the
guardianship of the Roman governor of Syria.
But these cities, particularly the trans-Jordanic ones,
joined together in a defensive and offensive league,
calling themselves the Decapolis. Pompey ordered
the most determined of his prisoners of war, the
zealots, to be executed, whilst the rest were taken
to Rome. The Judæan prince, Aristobulus, his son
Antigonus, his two daughters, and his uncle Absalom
were forced to precede Pompey's triumphal car,
in the train of the conquered Asiatic kings and
kings' sons. Whilst Zion veiled her head in mourning,
Rome was reveling in her victories; but the
Judæan prisoners that had been dragged to Rome
were to become the nucleus of a community destined
to carry on a new kind of warfare against long-established
Roman institutions, and ultimately to
modify or partly destroy them.</p>

<p>There were, without doubt, many Judæans living
in Rome and in other Italian cities before Pompey's
conquests, who may have emigrated into Italy from
Egypt and Asia Minor for commercial objects. As
merchants, bringing grain from the Nile country, or
tribute money from Asia Minor, they may have come
into contact with the Roman potentates. But these
emigrants could hardly have formed a regular communal
organization, for there were no authorized
teachers of the Law amongst them. Probably, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
some learned men may have followed in Pompey's
train of captives, who were ransomed by their
compatriots, and persuaded to remain in Rome.
The descendants of these prisoners were called
according to Roman law <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">libertini</i> (the freed ones).
The Judæan quarter in Rome lay upon the right
bank of the Tiber, on the slope of Mount Vatican,
and a bridge leading across that river to the Vatican
was known for a long while by the name of the
Bridge of the Judæans (Pons Judæorum). Theodus,
one of the Judæans settled in Rome, introduced
into his own community a substitute for the paschal
lamb, which could not be eaten outside of Jerusalem,
and the loss of which was a bitter deprivation
to the exiles. This aroused the displeasure of the
Judæans in the home country, who wrote to Theodus:
"If thou wert not Theodus, we should excommunicate
thee."</p>

<p>The Roman Judæans influenced, to a certain
extent, the course of Roman policy. For as the
original emigrants, as well as the ransomed captives,
enjoyed the power of voting in public assemblies,
they were able at times, by their combined action
on a preconcerted plan, by their assiduity, by their
temperate and passionless conception of the situation,
perhaps also by their keen intelligence, to turn
the scale upon some popular question. So important
was their quiet influence that the eloquent but
intolerant Cicero, who had learned to hate the
Judæans from his master Apollonius Molo, was
afraid on one occasion to give vent to his anti-Judæan
feelings in a public speech, for fear of stirring
them up against him. He had to defend the
unjust cause of a prætor Flaccus, who was accused
of having been guilty of numerous extortions during
his government of the Asia Minor provinces.
Amongst other things, Flaccus had seized upon the
votive offerings of the Temple (<i xml:lang="he" lang="he">aurum Judæorum</i>)
given by the community of Asia Minor&mdash;about two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
hundred pounds of gold, collected by the Judæan
inhabitants of the towns of Apamea, Laodicea,
Adramyttium, and Pergamus (62). In order to
justify his proceedings Flaccus cited a resolution of
the Senate, by which all exportation of money was
forbidden from Roman to foreign provinces; and
although Judæa had been conquered by Roman arms,
yet she did not enjoy the honor of being enrolled
amongst the provinces of the Republic. The Roman
Judæans were intensely interested in this trial, and
many of them were present among the populace.
The cowardly Cicero was so much afraid of them
that he would have liked to speak in a low
tone in order to be heard by the Judges but
not by the Judæans. In the course of his defense
he made use of an unworthy piece of sophistry,
which might have made an impression upon some
bigoted Roman, but which could hardly satisfy an
intelligent mind. "It requires great decision of
character," he said, "to oppose the barbaric superstitions
of the Judæans and, for the good of our
country, to show proper contempt towards these
seditious people, who invade our public assemblies.
If Pompey did not avail himself of a conqueror's
rights, and left the treasures of the Temple untouched,
we may be sure he did not restrain himself out of
reverence for the Judæan sanctuary, but out of
astuteness, to avoid giving the suspicious and slanderous
Judæan nation an opportunity of accusing
him; for otherwise he would hardly have spared
foreign, still less Judæan, sanctuaries. When Jerusalem
was unconquered, and when the Judæans were
living in peace, they displayed a deeply-rooted
antipathy to the glory of the Roman State, to the
dignity of the Roman name, and to the laws of our
ancestors. During the last war the Judæan nation
proved most effectually how bitterly they hate us.
How little this nation is beloved by the immortal
gods is now evident, as her country is conquered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
and leased out." What impression this speech
made upon the audience, and what decision was
given to Flaccus, are unknown. A year later Cicero
was punished by a sentence of banishment. He
was not allowed to be seen within eighty miles of
Rome, and his villas were razed to the ground.</p>

<p>After Pompey's departure from Syria, the thraldom
imposed upon dismembered Judæa became more
onerous than before, because she was left in the
anomalous condition of a partly conquered province
and a partly independent country. The powerful
minister of Hyrcanus contributed to make this condition
lasting and oppressive. He endeavored to
strengthen his connection with Rome by munificent
presents, trusting that the Republic would support
him, in spite of his unpopularity with the Judæan
people, who hated him as the cause of their subjection.
With the sweat from Judæa's brow he sustained
the Roman commander Scaurus, who had
opened a campaign against the Nabathæan king,
Aretas. Meanwhile Alexander II, the eldest son
of Aristobulus, escaping from captivity and arriving
in Judæa, gained the support of the patriots, and
putting himself at the head of fifteen hundred horse
and ten thousand foot soldiers, marched upon Jerusalem.
Hyrcanus, or more properly speaking his
master Antipater, could not resist so great a force,
and left the capital to Alexander, who entered and
had it fortified. The great Roman power fought
alternately upon either side, according to the bribes
that were offered its officials. Alexander felt so
secure of his position that he had coins struck with
the following inscription in Greek and Hebrew,
"King Alexander and High Priest Jonathan." Aulus
Gabinius, however, the governor of Syria, and the
most unscrupulous of the Roman extortioners of his
times, succeeded in ending this revolt and in subduing
Alexander. The death-stroke that awaited the
latter was only warded off by his mother, who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
embracing the knees of the Roman commander,
entreated him to show mercy to her son.</p>

<p>Gabinius succeeded in weakening the unity of the
Judæan State, which had of late been so unworthily
represented by the last of the Hasmonæans, but the
integrity of which had always been so jealously
watched over by the Great Council. Judæa was no
longer to be an independent State with self-governing
and legislative powers over the whole country,
but was to be divided into five provinces, each having
its own independent Senate or Synhedrion for
the control of home affairs. These assemblies were
held at specially appointed towns, at Jerusalem,
Gazara, Emmaus, Jericho, and Sepphoris; and
Judæans selected from the aristocratic party, who
were well disposed towards Rome, were placed at
the head of these councils.</p>

<p>Although the fact of having dismembered the
State testified in favor of Gabinius's political insight,
yet he deceived himself as regarded the ultimate
success of his plans. As the Synhedrion had grown
out of the innermost life of the whole nation and
had not been forced upon it by outside influences, it
was no easy matter to break its centralizing power.
The new scheme of dividing Judæa into five provinces
was hardly introduced before it disappeared
with Gabinius, leaving no trace of its existence. The
Great Council remained as before the heart of the
people, but its power was lessened by unfavorable
circumstances. From that time it was called the
"Synhedrion," and to distinguish it from the small
Councils, the "Great Synhedrion." But it could not
boast of any political power, for that was now
entirely in the hands of the Romans. Simon ben
Shetach, the celebrated president of the Council,
was succeeded by his two most distinguished disciples,
Shemaya (Sameas) and Abtalion (Pollion).
We can trace the despairing sentiments of that generation
in some of their sayings which have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
handed down to us: "Love thy handicraft and shun
governing; estrange thyself from worldly power."
"Be prudent in your words," said Abtalion to the
law-framers; "do not bring upon yourselves the
penalty of exile, for your disciples would have to
follow you into a land full of ensnaring influences
(poisonous waters) which they would imbibe, and the
sacred name of God would be through them profaned."
These two presidents of the Synhedrion
seem to have been Alexandrian Judæans, or at least
they must have spent some years of exile in Alexandria,
perhaps with their master Judah ben Tabbai.</p>

<p>During their twenty-five years of official life
(60&ndash;35), whilst the political power of the Synhedrion
was waning, their energy appears to have been
directed towards its inner or moral power. They
assembled a circle of eager disciples around them,
to whom they taught the tenets of the Law, their
origin and application. They were indeed accredited
in after ages with so profound a knowledge of
the Law, that to cite Shemaya or Abtalion in support
of an interpretation was considered indisputable
proof of its accuracy. One of their most distinguished
and most grateful disciples called them
"the two great men of the era," and the peculiarly
careful study of the Law, for which the Pharisees
became so justly celebrated, may be said to have
originated with them.</p>

<p>For some little time the history of Judæa contains
nothing but accounts of insubordination to
Roman despotism and its unhappy consequences,
of scenes of oppression and robbery, and of acts of
spoliation of the Temple. Aristobulus, who had
succeeded in escaping from Rome with his son
Antigonus, now appeared in Judæa. The rule of
the Romans was of so galling a character that Aristobulus,
who had not been a favorite in the old days,
was now received with unbounded enthusiasm. Sufficient
arms could not be procured for the volunteers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
who flocked to his camp. He was joined by Pitholaus,
a Judæan commander, who had once served as
a general to Hyrcanus. Aristobulus placed himself
at the head of 8000 men, and began immediately to
regarrison the citadel of Alexandrion, whence he
hoped to exhaust the Romans by guerrilla warfare.
But his impatient temper led him into open battle, in
which a large part of his army was utterly destroyed,
and the rest scattered. Still unsubdued, Aristobulus
threw himself with the remnant of his followers into
the citadel of Machærus, but at the approach of the
Romans with their battering-rams he was obliged
to capitulate, and for the second time was sent with
his sons into captivity at Rome (56).</p>

<p>Another insurrection, organized by his son Alexander,
who had obtained his freedom from the then
all-powerful Pompey, was doomed to come to as disastrous
a termination. Galled by the oppression of
the Governor of Syria, the inhabitants of that unfortunate
country sent an army of 30,000 men to join
Alexander. They commenced by killing all the
Romans who came in their way, Gabinius's troops
not being strong enough to oppose them. But the
Governor craftily succeeded in detaching some of
Alexander's followers from his ranks, and then
tempted the Judæan prince into open battle. At
Mount Tabor (in 55), the Judæans were signally
defeated.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the three most eminent men of Rome&mdash;Julius
Cæsar, distinguished by his brilliant sagacity,
Pompey by his martial renown, and Crassus by
his boundless wealth&mdash;had agreed to break the
power of the Senate, and to manage the affairs of
the State according to their own will. The triumvirs
began by dividing the fairest lands into provinces,
which they separately appropriated. Syria
fell to the share of Crassus, who was intensely avaricious
in spite of his vast riches. Judæa from this
time on was annexed to Syria quite as a matter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
course. Crassus went out of his way, when marching
against the Parthians, to enter Jerusalem, being
tempted thither by the rich treasury of the Temple.
He made no secret of his wish to seize upon the
two thousand talents that Pompey had spared. In
order to satisfy his greed, a pious priest, Eleazer,
delivered up to him a solid bar of gold, the existence
of which, hidden as it was in a hollow staff of
curiously carved wood, had been unknown to the
priests. Upon the receipt of this gift, Crassus
swore solemnly that he would spare the treasury of
the Temple. But when was a promise known to be
binding that was made by a Roman to a Judæan?
He took the golden bar, the two thousand talents,
and all the golden vessels of the Temple, which were
worth another eight thousand talents (54). Laden
with these and other spoils of the Sanctuary, Crassus
marched against the Parthians; but the Roman
arms had always failed to subdue this people. Crassus
was slain, and his army was so entirely disabled
that his legate, Cassius Longinus, returned to Syria
with scarcely the tenth part of the army of one hundred
thousand men (53). The Parthians pursued
the weakened army, and the Syrians, weary of the
Roman yoke, lent them secret aid. To the Judæans
this seemed an auspicious moment also for their own
emancipation.</p>

<p>It fell to Pitholaus to call the army together,
which he led against Cassius. Fortune, however,
always deserted the Judæan arms when they were
turned against the Romans. Shut up in Tarichea
on the lake of Tiberias, the troops were obliged to
surrender. Upon the urgent demand of Antipater,
Pitholaus was sentenced to death by Cassius, and
thirty thousand Judæan warriors were sold into
slavery (52).</p>

<p>But the imprisoned Aristobulus looked forward
once again to the hope of placing himself upon his
father's throne and of banishing Antipater into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
obscurity. Julius Cæsar, the greatest man that
Rome ever produced, had openly defied the Senate,
and broken with his associate Pompey. The bitter
strife between the two Roman potentates lit the
torch of war in the most distant provinces of the
Roman empire. Cæsar had given Aristobulus his
freedom, and in order to weaken Pompey's influence,
had sent him with two legions to Palestine to create
a diversion in his favor. But the partisans of Pompey
contrived to poison the Judæan prince. His
followers embalmed his body in honey and carried
it to Jerusalem, where it was buried beside the
bodies of the Hasmonæan princes. His eldest son,
the gallant Alexander, was decapitated by order of
Scipio, a follower of Pompey, at Antioch. The
widow of Aristobulus and his surviving son Antigonus
found protection with Ptolemy, prince of
Chalcis, whose son Philippion had fallen in love
with Alexandra, the daughter of Aristobulus, and
had brought her to his father's court. But Ptolemy,
out of criminal love to his own daughter-in-law,
caused his son to be murdered and married the
widow.</p>

<p>Antipater continued to be Pompey's faithful ally,
until the Roman general met with a miserable end
in Egypt. Then the Idumæan offered his services
to Cæsar. When the great general found himself
in Egypt, without sufficient forces, without news
from Rome, in the midst of a hostile population,
Antipater evinced a touching eagerness to help him,
which did not remain unrewarded. He provided
the army of Cæsar's ally, Mithridates, king of Pergamus,
with all necessaries, and sent him a contingent
of Judæan troops; he aided him in conquering
Pelusium, and conciliated the Egyptian-Judæans
who had taken the part of his opponent. He was
now well able to forego the favor of Hyrcanus.
To no effect did Antigonus, the last surviving son
of Aristobulus, seek an interview with Cæsar, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
which he dwelt upon his father's and his brother's
loyalty to the Roman general; Antipater had but
to display his wounds, which he had received in the
very last campaign, to gain the victory over his
rival. Cæsar, who was an astute reader of men,
and who had himself revolted from the legitimate
order of things, knew well enough how to value
Antipater's loyalty and energy, and did not support
the rightful claims of Antigonus. Out of consideration
for Antipater (47), Hyrcanus was proclaimed
high priest and ethnarch, and to Judæa was given
some relief from her burdens. The walls of Jerusalem
were rebuilt, the provinces that formerly
belonged to Judæa, namely, Galilee, the towns in
the plains of Jezreel, and Lydda, were once more
made part of her territory. The Judæans were no
longer forced to provide winter quarters for the
Roman legions, although the landowners were
obliged to give the fourth part of their harvest
every second year to the Roman troops.</p>

<p>Cæsar was altogether benevolent to the Judæans,
and rewarded them for their loyalty. To the
Alexandrian Judæans he granted many privileges,
confirming their long-enjoyed equality with the
Greeks, and permitting them to be governed by a
prince of their own (Ethnarch). Money was again
liberally provided for the Temple. Cæsar enabled
the supplies to reach their destination. He prevented
the Greek inhabitants of Asia Minor from
molesting the Judæans of those provinces, from summoning
them before the courts of justice on the
Sabbath, from interfering with their public assemblages
and the building of their synagogues, and
in general from disturbing them in their religious
observances (47&ndash;44). Cæsar must also have extended
his generosity to the Judæan community in
Rome, for they evinced the warmest devotion to
his memory.</p>

<p>But in spite of all these favors, the Judæan nation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
as a whole remained cold and distant. The foreign
communities of Judæans might bless Cæsar as their
benefactor, but the Palestinean Judæans could see
in him only the Roman, the patron of the hated
Idumæan. So defiant was the attitude of the nation
that Antipater felt himself compelled to threaten
the disaffected with the triple wrath of Cæsar, of
Hyrcanus and of himself, whilst he promised liberal
bounty to the obedient and loyal Judæans. Meanwhile,
a small body of men taken from the army of
Aristobulus had assembled under the command of
Ezekias upon one of the mountain heights of Galilee,
where they only awaited an opportune moment for
raising the standard of revolt against Rome. The
Romans, it is true, only looked upon this little army
as a band of robbers, and upon Ezekias as a robber
chieftain, but to the Judæans they were the avengers
of their honor and their freedom. For they were
deeply mortified that Antipater had placed the
reins of government in the hands of his sons, and
that he cared only for the growing power of his
house. Of the four sons born to him by Kypros,
the daughter of the King of Arabia, he proclaimed
Phasael, the eldest, Governor of Jerusalem and
Judæa, and the second, Herod, a youth of the age
of twenty, Governor of Galilee.</p>

<p>This prince was destined to become the evil genius
of the Judæan nation; it was he who brought her as
a bound captive to Rome; it was he who placed his
feet triumphantly upon her neck. Like an ominous
cloud weighted down with misfortune, he seems from
the very first to have thrown a dark shadow upon
the life of the nation, which, as it slowly but surely
advanced, quenched all light in the gathering darkness
and withered all growth, until nothing remained
but a scene of desolation. True to his father's
policy, Herod began by basely flattering Rome
and by wounding the Judæan spirit. In order to
gain favor with Cæsar, and also to establish the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
security of his family, he undertook a campaign
against the followers of Ezekias; he captured the
leader of the band, and, without any trial or show of
justice, sentenced him and his followers to decapitation.
Eager were the words of praise and of thanks
awarded to him by the Syrians and the Romans;
he was called the "Robber-subduer"; but whilst
he was loaded with favors by Sextus Cæsar, the
Roman Governor of Syria, all true patriots mourned.</p>

<p>The bitter degradation which the people suffered
at the hands of this Idumæan family inspired some
of the most distinguished Judæans to lay before the
weak-minded Hyrcanus the true state of their own
and of their High Priest's new position. They
explained to him that his dignity was but an empty
name, that all real power lay with Antipater and his
sons. They pointed to the execution of Ezekias
and his followers as an act of gross contempt for
the Law. These bitter complaints would have had
but little effect upon the weak Hyrcanus, had not
the mothers of the slain torn his heart with their
cries of anguish. Whenever he appeared in the
Temple they threw themselves before him and
entreated him not to let the death of their sons
remain unavenged.</p>

<p>At last Hyrcanus permitted the Synhedrion to
summon Herod before the seat of justice. But
Antipater did not fail to warn his son of the terrible
storm that was gathering over his head, and of the
danger of entering Jerusalem alone and unarmed;
while at the same time he cautioned him not to appear
surrounded by too many troops, and so arouse
the suspicions of Hyrcanus. Herod appeared at
the appointed time, but with an armed escort, and
with a letter from Sextus Cæsar, making the king
answerable for the life of the favorite. Thus the
day arrived for the great trial to which all the
inhabitants of Jerusalem were looking forward with
feverish impatience. When the members of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
court had taken their places, the accused, clad in
purple, with aggressive demeanor, and escorted by
his followers, appeared before them. At this sight
most of the accusers felt their courage fail them;
Herod's bitterest enemies looked downcast and
shamefaced, and even Hyrcanus was embarrassed.
A painful silence ensued, during which each man
stood breathless. Only one member found words
to save the waning dignity of the Council, the
President, Shemaya. Quietly and calmly he spoke:
"Is it not the intention of the accused to put us to
death if we pronounce him guilty? And yet I must
blame him less than the king and you, who suffer
such contempt to be cast upon the Law. Know,
then that he, before whom you are all trembling,
will one day deliver you to the sword of the
executioner." These words roused the fainting
courage of the judges, and they soon showed
themselves to be as determined as they had before
appeared to be cowardly. But Hyrcanus was
afraid of their growing wrath, and commanded the
Council to adjourn the sitting. Meanwhile Herod
withdrew from the anger of the people, and was
cordially received at Damascus by Sextus Cæsar,
who proclaimed him governor of C&oelig;lesyria (46).
Overwhelmed with honors, he was on the point of
wreaking his vengeance upon the king and the
Council, when his father and his brother Phasael
urged him to milder measures. But he silently
nursed his revenge, determined to gratify it upon
some future occasion.</p>

<p>The wide-spread disturbance occasioned by the
murder of Cæsar (44) involved Palestine in new
troubles. The Roman Judæans justly were so inconsolable
at the death of this great man that they
spent several entire nights mourning beside the
grave that contained his ashes. The internal struggles,
the bloody warfare, the constant proscriptions,
were but the labor-throes of Rome previous to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
birth of a new order of things; but for Judæa they
were to a certain extent a fresh attack of a fatal disease.
The heads of the republican party supplanted
those of the Cæsarian party, but merely to be supplanted
by them again in a short time; and this was
the case not only in Judæa, but in various parts of
the Roman empire. The republican, Cassius Longinus,
had arrived in Syria for the purpose of raising
troops and money, and demanded that Judæa should
supply him with 700 talents. Cassius was in desperate
haste, for any moment might deprive him of
the supreme power with which he ruled at that time
over persons and events in Syria. Thus he threw
the inhabitants of four Palestinean cities into chains
and sold them into slavery, because their contributions
were not delivered quickly enough.</p>

<p>The eyes of the unfortunate monarch, Hyrcanus,
were opened at last to the fact that the Idumæans
were seeking only their own interest under the
cloak of warm partisanship for his cause. He began
to be suspicious in his dealings with them, and turned
for support to a true and faithful friend, Malich, who
had long since recognized the duplicity of the Idumæans.
As yet Hyrcanus knew nothing of the
fiendish plot by which he was to be dethroned, and
which was to raise Herod, by the help of the Roman
legions, to the throne of Judæa. But this rumor
had reached the ears of Malich. Determined to rid
the king of the hated Antipater, he contrived to poison
him when he was feasting at a banquet with Hyrcanus
(43). In cutting at the root, he failed, however, to destroy
the growing evil, for Herod surpassed his father,
not only in determination and in audacity, but also in
duplicity. He avenged the death of Antipater by
the assassination of Malich. All attempts to ruin
the Idumæan brothers were unsuccessful. Even
when Herod fell suddenly and grievously ill, Phasael
was fortunate enough to subdue his enemies. A
plot conceived by Antigonus, the son of Aristobulus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
II, supported by his kinsman Ptolemy of
Chalcis, to deprive the Idumæans of their power,
failed likewise, and Herod compelled Hyrcanus to
crown him with the garland of victory when he made
his entry into Jerusalem. As a means of disarming
this terrible and mighty prince, Hyrcanus tried to
attach him to his house, by betrothing him to his
granddaughter Mariamne, celebrated in history no
less for her beauty than for her misfortunes. The
victim was to be bound to the executioner by the
bonds of marriage, and her own mother, Alexandra,
helped to bring about this miserable alliance.</p>

<p>Fortune smiled so persistently upon the Idumæan
that all changes in the political world, however they
might appear to damage his cause, only gave him
greater power. The republican army was completely
routed at Philippi (in 42), the leaders, Brutus and Cassius,
committed suicide, and the Roman world lay at
the feet of the second triumvirate&mdash;Octavius, Antony,
and Lepidus. Herod and Phasael looked upon
these changes with a troubled eye; for had they not
displayed the warmest zeal for the opponents of the
triumvirate? Besides this, some of the Judæan
nobles had hurried forth to meet the victor Antony
in Bithynia, carrying to him their complaints of the
rapacity of the Idumæan brothers. But Herod soon
found the means to scatter the clouds. He also
appeared before Antony with a smooth tongue and
ready money. Antony did not fail to remember
that he had formerly tasted of Antipater's hospitality.
He turned a deaf ear to the Judæan nobles, and dismissed
Herod with marks of favor. The voice of
the nation, which made itself heard through its
ambassadors, was no longer heeded. Antony sentenced
some of the unfortunate envoys to be thrown
into prison, and others to be executed, whilst he
proclaimed the two Idumæan brothers governors of
Judæa, with the title "Tetrarch."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
At one time it seemed as if this constant good
fortune were about to desert the Idumæan brothers
and to return to the Hasmonæan house. The Parthians,
stimulated by the fugitive Roman republican
Labienus, had made, under the command of their
king's son Pacorus, and his commander, Barzapharnes,
an inroad into Asia Minor and Syria, whilst
Mark Antony was reveling at the court of the bewitching
queen Cleopatra. The Parthians, enemies
of the Roman republic, were also violently antagonistic
to Herod and Phasael; they became doubly so
on account of their connection with Lysanias, the son
of Ptolemy, who was related to the house of Aristobulus,
and who had promised great rewards to the
Parthian commanders if they would sweep the hated
brothers out of the way, dethrone Hyrcanus, and
crown Antigonus. The Parthians agreed to this
scheme, and, dividing their army into two detachments,
marched by the sea-coast and the inland road
upon Jerusalem. At every step they were met and
joined by Judæan troops, who outstripped them in
their haste to arrive at the capital. Upon entering
Jerusalem they besieged the Hasmonæan palace,
and flocked to the Mount of the Temple. The common
people, in spite of being unarmed, supported
the invaders. The festival of Pentecost was at hand,
and a crowd of worshipers from all parts of Judæa
were streaming into Jerusalem; they also declared
themselves in favor of Antigonus. The Idumæans
held the palace and its fortress, and the invaders,
the city. Hyrcanus and Phasael were at last persuaded
by Pacorus, the king's cup-bearer, to go as
envoys of peace to the general, Barzapharnes, whilst
Herod was closely watched. Upon arriving at
Ecdippa the two unfortunate ambassadors were
thrown into prison, where Phasael committed suicide,
and where Hyrcanus had his ears mutilated, in order
to incapacitate him thereafter for holding his priestly
office. Plots were also laid to ensure the downfall of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
Herod, but, warned by some faithful followers of his
brother, he contrived to escape from his palace at
night. Accompanied by his bride Mariamne, and by
the female members of his family, he hurried to the
fortress Masada, which he left in command of his
brother Joseph, retiring first into Arabia, then into
Egypt, and finally to Rome. He was followed by
the execrations of the people. Antigonus was now
proclaimed king of Judæa (the Parthians carrying
off Hyrcanus to Babylon), and feeling himself to be
in truth a monarch, he had coins struck with his
Hebrew and Greek names: "Mattathias, High
Priest, and the Commonwealth of the Judæans," and
also "King Antigonus." The Parthian auxiliary
troops were dismissed, and Antigonus destroyed the
last of the Roman contingent that still held some of
the fortresses in Palestine. So Judæa was once
more freed from foreign soldiery, and could indulge
in the sweet dream of regained independence after
thirty hard years of internal troubles and terrible
warfare.</p>

<p class="center bpad">40&ndash;3 <span class="smcap smaller">B.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;E.</span></p>

<p>It is certain that Judæa derived her greatness and
independence rather from the tact and foresight of
the first Hasmonæans than from their skill in arms;
and in like manner she suffered humiliation and
bondage from the short-sightedness of the last Hasmonæan
kings, who did not understand how to make
use of the advantages within their grasp. Events
were most favorable for Antigonus to acquire extended
power. The Roman leaders were violently
opposed to one another. The provinces in the east,
unimportant in the eyes of Octavius, were looked
upon by Antony as the abode of luxury and pomp
rather than as an arena for warlike achievements.
The soft arms of Cleopatra had made the rough
couch of the war-goddess distasteful to him. The
Parthians, who hated the greed of Rome, had valiantly
repulsed her troops. Had Antigonus understood
how to keep alive the hatred of the people
towards the Idumæan house, the Romans themselves
would have courted him as an ally instead of
shunning him as an enemy, so eager were they for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
assistance in staying the progress of the Parthians.
The mountain tribes of Galilee had already declared
in favor of Antigonus; and Sepphoris, one of their
cities, had been converted into an arsenal; besides,
the caves of Arbela sheltered numerous bands
of freebooters, who might have proved dangerous
to the enemy's rear. But Antigonus was neither
a statesman nor a general. He did not know how
to turn to account the varied material which he had
at hand. The whole of his strength was frittered
away upon trivial aims; his leading passion was
the revenge which he meditated against Herod and
his brothers, and this retarded instead of stimulating
his activity. He did not know how to rise to the
truly royal height whence he could look down with
contempt instead of with hatred upon the Idumæan
upstarts. During his reign, which lasted three
years and a half (40&ndash;37), he undertook nothing
great or decisive, although the Roman officers, who
for the sake of appearances pretended to support
Herod, in point of fact usually occupied a neutral
position.</p>

<p>Even amongst his own people Antigonus did not
know the secret of winning men of influence to his
cause so that they would stand or fall with him.
The very leaders of the Synhedrion, Shemaya and
Abtalion, averse to Herod on account of his overwhelming
audacity, were not partisans of Antigonus.
It is somewhat difficult to understand entirely the
reason of this aversion to the Hasmonæan king.
Had Antigonus professed allegiance to Sadducæan
principles, or was there personal jealousy between
the representatives of the royal power and the
teachers of the Law? We are led to believe from
one circumstance, insignificant in itself, that the dislike
originated from the latter cause. It happened
once, upon the day of Atonement, that the entire
congregation, according to custom, had followed the
high priest, Antigonus, at the close of the divine service,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
from the Temple to his own residence. On
the way they met the two Synhedrists, Shemaya
and Abtalion; they quitted their priest-king to form
an escort for their beloved teachers of the Law.
Antigonus, vexed at this apparent insult, expressed
his displeasure to the Synhedrists by an ironical
obeisance, which they returned in the same offensive
way. This unfortunate variance with the most
influential men, coupled with Antigonus's lack of
generalship and statecraft, brought misfortune upon
himself, his house and the nation.</p>

<p>His rival Herod, who possessed all those qualities
in which he was deficient, was a man of a different
stamp. When fortune frowned upon him for a
time, he could always win back her smiles. His
flight from Jerusalem had been so desperate for him
that at one moment he contemplated suicide. His
design to make an ally of the Nabathæan king
failed. He wandered through the Judæan-Idumæan
desert, an outcast and penniless, but yet unbroken,
and revolving far-reaching schemes. He turned to
Egypt; there Cleopatra offered to make him general
of her army, but he refused, for he still clung to
the hope of wearing the crown of Judæa. He took
ship for Rome, and after being tempest-tossed and
narrowly escaping shipwreck, he arrived at his destination
at the favorable moment when Octavius
and Antony had once more agreed upon the Brundisian
treaty. He found no difficulty in persuading
Antony that he could render him great service in
repulsing the Parthians, and he convinced him that
Antigonus, raised to the throne of Judæa by the
Parthians, would always be an implacable enemy to
the Romans. Antony was completely deceived by
the craft and subtlety of Herod. He spoke favorably
of him to Octavius, who dared not refuse him
anything. Thus within seven days, Herod succeeded
in having the Senate proclaim him King of Judæa,
and Antigonus pronounced an enemy of Rome (40).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
This was the second death-blow that Rome had
dealt the Judæan nation, in delivering her up to the
mercy of an alien, a half-Judæan, an Idumæan, who
had his own personal insults to avenge. Judæa was
forced to submit, and in addition to pay tribute-money
to Rome.</p>

<p>Herod, seeing that his ambition was to be
crowned with success, now left Antony (who had
loaded him with honors), in order to assume the
royal title conferred upon him. He left Rome and
arrived at Acco (39). He was supplied with sums
of money by various friends, and especially by
Saramalla, the richest Judæan in Antioch. With
these moneys he hired mercenaries and subdued a
great part of Galilee. He then hastened southwards,
to relieve the fortress of Masada, where his
brother Joseph was hard pressed by the friends of
Antigonus. This struggle was of long duration, as
the Romans were unwilling to take an active part in
the contest. Herod felt the necessity of appearing
in person in Antony's camp, which at that moment
was pitched before Samosata, there to plead his
own cause. Partly in return for the services he rendered
to the Roman commander upon this occasion,
and partly through his persuasive powers, he
induced Antony to send Sosius, one of his generals,
at the head of two legions, to resolutely carry on
the contest against Antigonus, and to establish
upon the throne the king selected by Rome.</p>

<p>This war was carried on by Herod with implacable
severity. Five cities in the neighborhood of
Jericho, with their inhabitants to the number of
2000, who had sided with Antigonus, he ordered to
be burnt. In the following spring (37), he commenced
the siege of Jerusalem. Previous to this,
he celebrated in Samaria, with hands stained with
the blood of its inhabitants, his nuptials with Mariamne,
to whom he had now for several years been
betrothed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
As soon as Sosius had advanced into Judæa with
a large army of Roman infantry, cavalry and Syrian
mercenaries, the siege of Jerusalem was pressed.
The besieging army numbered one hundred thousand
men. They built ramparts, filled up the
moats, and prepared their battering-rams. The
besieged, though suffering from want of food, defended
themselves heroically. They made occasional
sorties, dispersed the workmen, destroyed
the preparations for the siege, built up a new wall,
and harassed the besiegers to such an extent that
after one month's labor they had not advanced
to any extent in their work. But the two Synhedrists,
Shemaya and Abtalion, raised their voices
against this opposition, and recommended their
countrymen to open their gates to Herod.</p>

<p>This division of purpose amongst the besieged,
combined with the attacks of the invaders, may
have hastened the fall of the northern wall, which
took place at the end of forty days. The besiegers
rushed into the lower town and into the outworks
of the Temple, while the besieged, with their king,
fortified themselves in the upper town and on the
Temple Mount. The Romans were occupied during
another fortnight with the storming of the south
wall. On a Sabbath evening, when the Judæan
warriors were least expecting an attack, a portion
of the wall was taken, and the Romans rushed like
madmen into the old part of the city and into the
Temple. There, without distinction of age or sex,
they slaughtered all who came in their way, even
the priest beside his sacrifice. By a strange
fatality, Jerusalem fell on the anniversary of the day
on which, twenty-seven years previously, the Temple
had been taken by Pompey. It was hardly possible
for Herod to restrain his savage soldiery from plundering
and desecrating the holy spot, and it was
only by giving costly gifts to each soldier that he
prevented the entire destruction of Jerusalem.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
Antigonus was thrown into chains and sent to
Antony, who, upon Herod's persistent entreaties,
and contrary to all custom and usage, had him tortured
and then ignobly beheaded. This disgraceful
treatment excited the opprobrium even of the
Romans.</p>

<p>Herod, or, as the people called him, the Idumæan
slave, had thus reached the goal of his lofty desires.
His throne, it is true, rested upon ruins and upon
the dead bodies of his subjects; but he felt that he
had the power to maintain its dignity, even if it were
necessary to carry a broad river of blood round its
base. The bitter hatred of the Judæan people,
whose ruler he had become without the slightest
lawful title, was nothing to him as compared with
the friendship of Rome and the smile of Antony.
His line of action was clearly marked out for him
by the situation of affairs: he had to cling to the
Romans as a support against the ill-will of his
people, and meet this ill-will by apparent concessions,
or control it by unrelenting severity.
This was the policy that he followed from the
first moment of his victory until he drew his last
breath. During all the thirty-four years of his
reign he followed this line of policy, cold and heartless
as fate, and entailing the most terrible consequences.
Even in the first confusion attendant
upon the conquest of the Temple Mount, he had
not lost his coolness and vigilance, but had ordered
his satellite Costobar to surround the exits of Jerusalem
with his soldiery, and thus to prevent the
escape of the unfortunate fugitives. The followers
of Antigonus were slain in large numbers, many
amongst them being of the most distinguished
families. Herod did not forget old grievances.
The Synhedrists, who twelve years previously had
decreed his death, were killed to a man, with the
exception of Abtalion and Shemaya, who had been
hostile to Antigonus. He seized the property of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
those whom he executed or otherwise condemned
for the royal treasury; for this worthy pupil of Roman
masters was fully alive to the advantages of proscription
and confiscation. He passed over the Hasmonæan
house in selecting a high priest, and chose
a certain Ananel, a descendant of Aaron, but not of
high-priestly family, for that office. He declared
that his own was an old Judæan family which had
returned from Babylonia, wishing in this way to
obliterate the fact that he was descended from an
Idumæan ancestor who had been forced to accept
Judaism. The natives of Jerusalem, who had a
good memory for his true extraction, did not indeed
lend an ear to this invention, but foreign Judæans
and heathens may perhaps have been deceived by
it. His confidential friend and historian, Nicolaus
of Damascus, relates this fiction as coming from his
own lips. At the death of Shemaya and Abtalion,
the presidents of the Synhedrion were chosen from
a Babylonian-Judæan family, that of Bene Bathyra.</p>

<p>Two persons still existed who might prove dangerous
to Herod: an old man and a youth&mdash;Hyrcanus,
who had once worn the crown and the priestly
diadem, and his grandson Aristobulus, Herod's
brother-in-law, who had claims upon both the royal
and the priestly dignity. Herod could not devote
himself to the calm enjoyment of his conquest until
these two should be powerless. Hyrcanus, it was
true, who had fallen captive to the Parthians, had
been mutilated by them, and was therefore unfit to
resume his priestly office; but his captors had
generously granted him freedom, and the aged
monarch had been joyfully and reverentially welcomed
by the community of Babylonian Judæans.
In spite of the devotion which he received from
these people, Hyrcanus had an intense longing
to return to his native land, and Herod was afraid
that he might induce the Babylonian Judæans or the
Parthians to take up his cause and help him regain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
his throne, from which the latter had torn him.
Anxious to avert this danger, Herod bethought himself
of taking Hyrcanus from Parthian influence and
of bringing him under his own power. It was thus
that the aged monarch received a pressing invitation
to Jerusalem to share the throne and the power of
king Herod, and to receive the thanks of the
Idumæan for past acts of kindness that Hyrcanus
had shown him. Vainly did the Babylonian Judæans
warn the credulous prince not to let himself be
drawn a second time into the eddy of public life;
he hurried to his doom. Herod received him with
every mark of respect, and gave him the place of
honor at his table and in the Council, masking
his treachery so completely that Hyrcanus was
entirely deceived. He was unarmed and powerless
in a golden cage.</p>

<p>But more dangerous to Herod seemed his young
brother-in-law Aristobulus, the only brother of Mariamne,
who, on account of his lineage, his youth,
and his surpassing beauty, had attracted the love
and devotion of all his people. Herod, in debarring
him from the dignity of high priest, imagined that
he had successfully destroyed his influence. But this
was not so. Alexandra, the mother of Mariamne
and Aristobulus, as well versed in intrigue as Herod
himself, had succeeded in obtaining Antony's favor
for her son. She had sent the portraits of her children,
the most beautiful of their race, to the Roman
triumvir, believing his weak nature might be worked
upon most favorably through the senses. Antony,
in truth, struck by the portraits, requested to see
Aristobulus. But Herod, in order that this meeting
should not take place, suddenly proclaimed the
young Hasmonæan high priest, and Ananel was
deprived of this dignity. But Alexandra was far
from being satisfied, for she was secretly determined
that her son should also wear the crown which his
ancestors had worn. Herod, fully alive to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
peril, was all the more determined to rid himself of
this dangerous youth. Aristobulus had already
gained the heart of the people, and whenever he
appeared in the Temple, every eye hung upon his
noble and perfect form, every glance seemed to
avow that the Judæans were longing to see this last
scion of the Hasmonæan house seated upon the royal
throne. Herod durst not act with open violence
against his rival, who was looked upon with special
favor by Queen Cleopatra, but as usual he resorted
to treachery. He invited Aristobulus to Jericho,
and bade his followers dispatch the youth whilst he
was disporting in the bath. Thus died, at the early
age of seventeen, Aristobulus III., the last male
representative of the Hasmonæan house. Herod
then reappointed his puppet Ananel as high priest.
It was vain for the Idumæan to affect deep grief at
the death of his young brother-in-law, it was vain
for him to throw sweet perfume upon his body; all
the relations and friends of the murdered Hasmonæan
accused Herod in their hearts of his death,
although their lips gave no utterance to their
thoughts.</p>

<p>But this crime brought its own bitter punishment
with it, and made Herod's whole life one long tale
of misery. The agony of remorse that might have
wrought some change upon a less hardened nature
was not felt, but only an ever-increasing suspicion
towards those of his own household, which urged
him to heap crime upon crime, to murder his nearest
relatives, even his own children, until he became at
last the most terrible example of a sin-laden existence.
Alexandra, who had staked her ambitious hopes
upon the coronation of her son, and who now found
herself so cruelly deceived, did not hesitate to accuse
Herod before Cleopatra of the murder of Aristobulus.
This queen, whose passions were uncontrolled,
and who looked with an envious eye upon
Herod's newly acquired kingdom, took advantage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
of his crime to make its author appear odious in the
eyes of Antony. Herod was summoned to Laodicea.
Trembling for his life, the vassal king obeyed
the summons, but succeeded in ingratiating himself
so thoroughly by costly gifts and by carefully chosen
yet eloquent words, that not only was the death of
Aristobulus overlooked, but he was distinguished
by marks of esteem, and sent back to Jerusalem,
full of happy self-confidence. He lost, however, one
precious pearl from his crown. The far-famed district
of Jericho, celebrated for its wealth of palm-trees
and its highly-prized balsam, had been given
by Antony to Cleopatra, and Herod was forced to
accept two hundred talents in lieu as tribute-money
from the queen. He could, however, rest well satisfied
with this loss, when comparing it with the
danger from which he had escaped.</p>

<p>On the threshold of his palace, however, the demon
of discord awaited him, ready to fill his whole being
with despair. On the eve of his departure he had
entrusted his wife Mariamne to the care of Joseph,
the husband of his sister Salome, and had given him
the secret command that, in case of his falling a victim
to Antony's displeasure, Joseph should murder both
Mariamne and Alexandra. Love for his beautiful
wife, whom he could not bear to think of as belonging
to another, added to hatred of Alexandra, who
should not triumph in his death, prompted this
fiendish resolve. But Joseph had betrayed his secret
mission to Mariamne, and had thus plunged another
dagger into the heart of that unhappy queen. When
a false report of Herod's death became current in
Jerusalem, Mariamne and her mother prepared to
put themselves under Roman protection. Herod's
sister Salome, who hated both her husband Joseph
and her sister-in-law Mariamne, made use of this
fact to calumniate them upon her brother's return,
accusing them of a mutual understanding and undue
intimacy. Herod at first turned a deaf ear to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
calumny, but when Mariamne disclosed to her husband,
amidst tears of indignation, that Joseph had
confessed his secret mission to her, then the king's
wrath knew no bounds. Declaring that he fully
believed his sister's accusations, he beheaded Joseph,
placed Alexandra in confinement, and would have
had Mariamne slain, had not his love for his queen
surpassed even his rage. From that day, however, the
seeds of distrust and hatred were sown in the palace,
and they grew and spread until one member of the
royal family after another met with an untimely and
violent death.</p>

<p>Outwardly, however, fortune appeared to smile
upon Herod, carrying him successfully over the most
difficult obstacles in his path. Before the sixth year
of his reign had ended, threatening clouds began to
gather over his head. A surviving sister of the last
Hasmonæan king Antigonus had arisen as the
avenger of her brother and his race, and had, in some
way or other, possessed herself of the fortress of
Hyrcanion. Herod had hardly disarmed this female
warrior before he was threatened by a more serious
danger. Cleopatra, who had always hated the Judæans,
and who had been most ungenerous to that
community in Alexandria during a year of famine,
had again attempted to effect Herod's ruin by
awakening Antony's displeasure against him. Afraid
of this violent and yet crafty queen, and alarmed at the
hatred of his own people, who were longing for his
downfall, Herod determined upon preparing some
safe retreat, where his life would at all events be
secure from his enemies. He chose for this purpose
the fortress of Masada, which nature had rendered
almost impregnable, and which he fortified still more
strongly. But Cleopatra was already devising
another scheme for the downfall of her enemy. She
succeeded in entangling him in a war with Malich,
the Nabathæan king, and thus endeavored to bring
about the ruin of two equally hated monarchs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
But Herod gained two decisive victories over the
Nabathæans, which alarmed Cleopatra, and caused
her to send her general Athenion to the aid of
Malich. The Judæan army sustained a terrible
defeat, and Herod was beaten back across the Jordan.
This disaster was followed by an earthquake,
which alarmed and dispirited the Judæan troops to
such an extent that they lost all courage and were
almost powerless before the enemy. But Herod,
with true genius, succeeded in rousing his people,
and in leading them victoriously against the Nabathæans.
Malich was forced to become the vassal
of the Judæan king.</p>

<p>Hardly, however, was peace restored before a
storm arose that threatened to shake the Roman
world to its very depths and to destroy the favorite
of the Roman generals. Ever since that day when
Rome and her vast possessions lay at the feet of
the triumvirs, who hated each other cordially, and
each one of whom wished to be sole ruler of the
state, the political atmosphere had been charged
with destructive elements that threatened to explode
at any given moment. Added to this, one of the
three leaders was completely under the sway of the
dissolute and devilish Queen Cleopatra, who had set
her heart upon becoming mistress of Rome, even
though this should entail the devastation of whole
countries by fire and by sword.</p>

<p>It was during this highly excited period that a
Judæan author foretold, in beautiful Greek verse,
written in the form of a sibylline prophecy, the
coming destruction of the Roman-Greek state, and
the reign of Belial, who would decoy the unhappy
ones to their final destruction; but this Judæo-Greek
seer also heralded the coming of a glorious
Messiah. An era of crime had certainly begun, and
a Belial had appeared in the person of the half-Judæan
Herod, but as yet no Messianic dawn of
better things was apparent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
With the declaration of war between Octavius
and Antony, a fierce strife broke out between the
Western and the Eastern provinces of Rome; it
was Europe against Asia&mdash;a war of nations. But
it came to a sudden end with the fall of Antony in
the battle of Actium (31). This blow struck Herod
severely; neither he nor his friends doubted for one
moment that he would be submerged in the ruin
of his protector, for he had been closely allied to
Antony. He was prepared for the worst, but he
determined not to be outlived by the aged Hyrcanus,
by his wife Mariamne, or by his mother-in-law
Alexandra. He accused Hyrcanus of having conspired
with the Nabathæan king, and ordered the
innocent monarch to be executed. Mariamne and
Alexandra he placed under the guardianship of the
Ithuræan Soem in the fortress of Alexandrion.
Herod then prepared to present himself before the
conqueror, Octavianus Cæsar, and if he met with
his death, as was most probable, Mariamne and her
mother were to be instantly murdered.</p>

<p>On the eve of Herod's departure, he found himself
compelled to make some change in the Synhedrion,
and to appoint the Babylonian Hillel, a man
unknown until then, as one of the presidents. This
gave a new direction to the spirit of Judaism, which
has affected that faith down to the present. Hillel,
born about the year 75, traced back his descent, on
his mother's side, to the house of David. Although
his lineage was a distinguished one, he was living in
needy circumstances, and was supported by his rich
brother, Shebna. He probably accompanied Hyrcanus
on his return from Babylon to Jerusalem, and
became one of the most devoted disciples of the
Synhedrists, Shemaya and Abtalion, whose traditional
lore he endeavored to transmit literally and
faithfully.</p>

<p>Hillel was particularly distinguished for his winning,
dove-like gentleness, his intense love of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
humanity, which arose from his own humility, and
from his deep faith in others, and lastly, for that
perfect equanimity proceeding from his profound
trust in God, that never wavered in the midst of
trouble. In later ages he was revered as the ideal
of modesty and gentleness. When he was once
asked to express the essence of Judaism in one
sentence, he uttered this golden maxim: "Do not
unto others what thou wouldst not have done unto
thyself. This is the principal commandment: all
others are the development of that one." If strife
and dissension arose, Hillel was invariably the
peacemaker. His beneficence knew no bounds, and
he had that rare delicacy of feeling which never
humiliates the recipient by the gift, but which rather
helps him to maintain his self-respect. His faith
in God raised him triumphantly above every fear.
All the members of his household were imbued
through his example with the same faith; so much
so that once, upon entering the town and hearing a
cry of distress, he was able confidently to remark,
"That cry cannot have proceeded from my house."
Hillel has bequeathed a greater number of maxims
to us than any of his predecessors. We read
amongst them the following: "If I were not to care
for myself (my soul), who would do so for me? If I
care for myself alone, what can I effect? If not
now, when then?" "Be of the disciples of Aaron,
love peace, seek peace, love mankind, thus lead
them to the Law." Impressed by the sublime mission
of Israel, that of maintaining and teaching the
pure belief in one God, he exclaimed at one of the
festivals in the Temple: "If I (Israel) am here,
then is everything here; if I should be wanting, who
would be here?" The doctrines of Judaism were so
profoundly revered by him that his indignation was
roused whenever they were used as stepping-stones
to the schemes of the ambitious. "He who wishes
to raise his name, lowers it; he who does not seek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
the Law, does not deserve to live. He who does
not progress in learning, retrogrades; he who uses
the crown of the Law for his own ends, perishes."</p>

<p>Hillel became in after years the very ideal of his
co-religionists. The impetus given by him to the
development of doctrinal Judaism marks an epoch in
the history of that faith. He greatly enriched the
mass of the traditional lore that he had imbibed
from the Synhedrists, Shemaya and Abtalion. But
far more important was his logical derivation of
the statutes of the Law observed in his time. He
traced them back to their first principles, and raised
them out of the narrow circle of tradition and mere
custom to the height of reason. The traditional
law, according to Hillel, carries within itself its
justification and binding power, it does not depend
on authority alone. Thus, to a certain extent, he
paved the way to a reconciliation between Pharisees
and Sadducees by placing before them the
principles common to both, from which neither of
them could withhold their assent. On the one
hand, Hillel agreed with the Sadducæan principle,
that a law can only be valid if founded upon scriptural
authority; but, on the other hand, he declared
that this authority did not merely lie in the dead
letter, but was also to be derived from the general
spirit of the scriptural writings. After this demonstration
by Hillel, no dispute amongst the schools
could arise as to the binding power of traditional
law. By the introduction of seven rules, or Middoth,
the oral law could be imbued with the same
weight and authority as that actually contained in
the Scriptures. Through these seven rules the oral
law assumed quite a different aspect; it lost its
apparently arbitrary character; it became more universal
and reasonable in its tendency, and might
be looked upon as originating from Holy Writ itself.</p>

<p>These explanatory rules were, moreover, intended
not only to justify the oral law, but also to lay down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
instructions how to amplify the laws, and how to
meet unforeseen cases of difficulty. At first they
appear to have been unfavorably received. It is
expressly narrated that Hillel introduced them at a
council of the Bathyrene Synhedrion, but that
assembly may either have misinterpreted them or
have disputed their expediency. In the meantime
an opportunity presented itself of having recourse
to these explanatory rules, for a question was
raised, the solution of which deeply excited the whole
nation, and to this opportunity Hillel owed the dignified
position of President of the Synhedrion. The
eve of the festival on which the Paschal Lamb was
to be sacrificed occurred on the Sabbath, a most
unusual event at that time, and the Bathyrene Synhedrion
could not throw any light upon the disputed
question, whether it was permitted or not to sacrifice
the Paschal Lamb on the Sabbath Day. Hillel,
whose ability must have attracted the attention of the
discerning before, had taken part in the discussion,
and had proved that according to the explanatory
rules, the Pesach, or Paschal Sacrifice, like every
other whole offering, supersedes the Sabbath. The
debate became heated, the mass of the people being
warmly interested in the celebration of the festival.
Expressions of approval and censure for Hillel were
freely uttered. Some cried, "We have to look to
the Babylonians for the best information"; others
ironically asked, "What good can we expect from
the Babylonians?"</p>

<p>From that day Hillel's name became so popular
that the Bathyrene Synhedrists resigned their offices&mdash;whether
of their own free will, or because they
were forced to do so by the people, is not known&mdash;and
conceded the Presidency to Hillel himself (about
30). Hillel, far from being proud of his exalted
position, expressed himself as dissatisfied, and
angrily reproved the Synhedrists. "Why is it," he
asked, "that I, an insignificant Babylonian, became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
President of the Synhedrion? Only because you
have been too indolent to heed the teachings of
Shemaya and Abtalion." Herod does not seem to
have made any objection to the choice.</p>

<p>One of the statutes which Hillel had introduced
was of general interest, and proved that he had
true insight into affairs of life. In the Sabbatical
year all debts were by law canceled. At the time
when the state was a republic based upon moral
laws, this was a wise measure for equalizing property;
but at a later period, when capital became
a power in itself, the rich were not willing to relieve
their less wealthy neighbors from their difficulties by
giving them loans. On this account Hillel, without
entirely abrogating the law which already existed,
ruled that the creditor should give over the debt in
writing to the Court, so that the Court might collect
it, and the creditor be relieved from the necessity of
violating the law. This timely statute, equally advantageous
to debtor and creditor, was called by the
Greek word <i xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">Prosbol</i>, because the debt was given
over to the Council of the Elders.</p>

<p>At Herod's particular desire, the second place of
honor, that of Deputy of Hillel, was given to the
Essene Menahem, to whom the king showed great
partiality. The cause of this attachment was as
follows (at least so the tale ran in later days):
Menahem, by means of the prophetic power ascribed
to the Essenes, had foretold during his childhood
that Herod would one day be king in Jerusalem, and
that his reign would be a brilliant one, but that he
would fail in piety and justice. That which had appeared
incredible to the youth recurred to the man
when he wore the regal crown. But Menahem
appears not to have found his office congenial,
and soon withdrew in favor of Shammai, whose characteristics,
opposed in many ways to those of Hillel,
in reality supplemented them. Shammai was probably
by birth a Palestinean, and therefore much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
interested in all the political and religious controversies
of his native land. His religious views were
strict to a painful extreme. But Shammai was not
of a gloomy or misanthropical disposition; indeed,
he encouraged friendliness in demeanor towards
every one. This is indicated by the maxim which
has come down to us, "Let your work in the Law
be your principal occupation; speak little, but do
much, and receive all men with a friendly countenance."</p>

<p>The two Synhedrists, Hillel and Shammai,
founded two separate schools, opposed to each
other in many religious, moral, and legal questions,
which, with their different tendencies, exerted
a powerful influence, during the subsequent unsettled
and warlike times, upon events of historical
importance. Herod had no conception of the forces
antagonistic to his house that were quietly developing
within the seclusion of these schools.</p>

<p>With a trembling heart he had presented himself
at Rhodes before Octavianus Cæsar, who, since the
defeat of Antony at Actium, was sole master of the
Roman provinces. He, so haughty in his own
country, appeared in meek and lowly guise at the
footstool of the mighty ruler, yet not without a certain
manly resolution. In his interview with Octavianus,
Herod did not in any way conceal the position
he had held with relation to Antony; but he
took care to dwell upon the fact of his having
refrained from aiding Antony after his defeat at
Actium, thereby intimating to Octavianus what use
he might make of the devotion and zeal which
Herod was prepared to transfer from the cause of
Antony to that of his conqueror. Octavianus was
neither noble enough to despise so venal a man, nor
did he feel secure enough to do without him.</p>

<p>So he graciously encouraged the pleading Herod,
bade him array himself as before in royal robes,
and sent him back to his own country laden with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
honors (30). Herod found no difficulty in becoming
as loyal a partisan of Octavianus as he had
been for twelve long years of Antony. During
the campaign of the second Cæsar against Egypt,
he was met at Acco by Herod bearing rich presents,
and the Judæan king supplied the Roman army with
water and with wine during their march through an
arid country. It is possible that Antony may have
heard, before he put an end to his life, that Herod's
loyalty was not founded on a rock. Herod had also
the malicious joy of knowing that his persistent
enemy, Cleopatra, who had failed to fascinate the
conqueror by her attractions, had nothing left but
to seek death. The Alexandrian Judæans, who had
suffered from her hatred, shared Herod's feelings.
For, but a short time previous to her death, this
terrible woman had longed to assassinate with her
own hands the Judæans who were living in the capital
of Egypt, and who were devoted to the cause of
Octavianus. The Egyptian Judæans were rewarded
for their devotion by an official recognition of their
equality with the rest of the inhabitants; in fact,
Octavianus had such confidence in their loyalty
that he placed the harbors of the Nile and of
the sea under the control of the Judæan Alabarchs,
who had held that office under former Egyptian
monarchs. This was a special mark of favor, for
the possession of Egypt, the Roman granary, and
particularly of the harbor of Alexandria, was so
precious to the first emperor of Rome that no
Senator dared approach that country without the
imperial permission. When the Alabarch who was
then in office died, Octavianus allowed his successor
to be chosen by the Alexandrian Judæans, and
granted him all the rights of his predecessors. Whilst
he governed the Greek Alexandrians with extreme
severity on account of their depravity, their untrustworthiness
and their love of sedition, and kept them
strictly under his own rule, he appointed a Judæan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
Council to assist the Alabarchs or Ethnarchs. The
Judæan community was thus governed by one of its
own race, who decided all the judicial questions and
provided for the carrying out of all imperial commands
and behests.</p>

<p>Octavianus also granted to the numerous Judæans
who were settled in Rome, the Libertini, if
not extraordinary privileges, at least the right of
observing their own religious customs, and thus set
a worthy example to his successors. The Judæans
were allowed to build synagogues, where they
worshiped according to their rites; they were also
permitted to transmit their yearly contributions to
the Temple in Jerusalem, although, in general, it
was forbidden to send large sums out of Rome.
The Roman Judæans also received their due portion
of the grain that was distributed amongst the population.
If the distribution happened to take place
on a Sabbath, their portion was allotted to them on
the following day. These were the orders of the
emperor.</p>

<p>Octavianus made over to Herod the splendid body-guard
of Cleopatra, numbering four hundred Gauls,
and he placed under his jurisdiction several seaports
that had been torn from Judæa, as well as the territory
of Jericho. Samaria, as also Gadara and
Hippos in trans-Jordanic territory, were also incorporated
with Judæa. The area of the kingdom was
now identical with what it had been before the civil
war between the royal brothers and the first intervention
of the Romans; but different, indeed, were
the circumstances under which she had regained her
possessions! Probably it was due to Herod's boundless
sycophancy to Rome that sacrifices were now
regularly offered up for the welfare of the Cæsars,
Augustus and his consort presenting in return
golden vessels for the use of the Temple.</p>

<p>Herod was now at the very zenith of his power;
the untoward fortune that he had feared had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
only been averted, but had actually assisted in
exalting him. He was not, however, to enjoy his
good fortune; the terrible consequences of his
crimes clung to his footsteps and changed his cup
of happiness into one of gall. In the narrow circle
of his own home a tragedy was about to be enacted,
far more terrible than could have been conceived by
the imagination of a poet. Mariamne, who, as well
as her mother Alexandra, had been in close confinement
during the king's absence, had elicited from
her gaoler Soem the fact that she would not have
been permitted to outlive Herod. Upon the king's
return she made no secret of her hatred for him, and
when he spoke to her in words of tenderness and
affection, she taunted him with the murders of her
brother, her grandfather and many others of her
relatives. Herod's heart was torn by the love he
bore to this beautiful woman and by the wrath he
felt at her persistent enmity to his person and his
power. Whilst still a prey to these conflicting feelings
he was only too ready to lend a willing ear to
the malicious inventions of his sister Salome, who
assured him that his cup-bearer had been bribed
by Mariamne to poison him. During the investigation
that ensued it transpired that Soem had disclosed
his secret instructions to the queen, and this
treachery on the part of a confidential servant let
loose a host of wild passions within Herod's breast.
Soem was decapitated on the spot. Whilst still
moved by his ungovernable rage, Herod summoned
a council, before whom he accused his wife of adultery
and of an attempt to poison him. The judges
passed the sentence of death upon her, and, wishing
to curry favor with Herod, ordered the execution
to take place forthwith. It was thus that the most
beautiful woman in Judæa, the Hasmonæan princess,
the pride of her people, was led to the scaffold.
She went to her doom with remarkable fortitude,
without the faintest tremor or the least display of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
feminine weakness, worthy of her heroic ancestry
(29). We may take Mariamne as the symbol of
Judæa, delivered up to the axe of the executioner
by intrigue and passion.</p>

<p>But Mariamne's death did not quench Herod's
thirst for revenge; on the contrary, it brought
on still fiercer paroxysms of rage. He could not
endure her loss, and became a prey to sickness
and insanity. He would call frantically upon her
name in a passion of sobs and tears; and he had
her body embalmed in honey, so that he might keep
it in his presence. It was whilst traveling in
Samaria that he fell so dangerously ill that the doctors
despaired of his life, and when this intelligence
reached his capital, Alexandra proceeded to possess
herself of Jerusalem. But the king's vitality returned
upon the rumor of this sudden peril to his throne,
and Alexandra fell a victim to her sedition. She
was the very last who bore the Hasmonæan name,
and she had lived long enough to witness the violent
and disgraceful deaths of her father-in-law
Aristobulus II, her husband Alexander, her brother-in-law
Antigonus, her son Aristobulus III, her father
Hyrcanus II, and her daughter Mariamne.</p>

<p>The remaining two-thirds of the Herodian reign
are devoid of any real progress; the record of that
time tells of cringing submission to Augustus and
to Rome, of the erection of magnificent edifices, of
the love of pomp and display, of deeply-rooted
moral corruption, of unsuccessful conspiracies and
court intrigues, leading to new crimes and further
executions. In order to retain the favor of the all-powerful
Augustus, Herod introduced into Jerusalem
the celebration of the Actian games, occurring
every fifth year, in remembrance of Augustus'
victory over his rival, he also built theaters and
arenas, where he organized combats between gladiators
or wild beasts, thus arousing the displeasure
of the national party, who rightly divined that it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
intended that Judaism soon should be absorbed by
a Pagan-Roman worship, and who recognized in the
Roman trophies and eagles displayed in the theaters,
the introduction of Roman deities. Herod gave his
people another cause for umbrage, in the fact that
he was not only ornamenting the hated city of
Samaria, within a circumference of half a mile, with
the most beautiful buildings, but that he also contemplated
making that city the capital of his dominions,
a dignity for which she was singularly adapted
by her fortunate position. The newly-built Samaria
was renamed Sebaste, just as the citadel Baris, the
armory of the Hasmonæans in old days, on the
northwest side of the Temple, had been called
Antonia in honor of Antony. In fact, Judæa became
crowded with cities and with monuments which bore
the names of Herod's own family or those of his
Roman protectors. The fortress of Straton on the
sea was, by most lavish expenditure, converted into
a beautiful city, with an extensive harbor, and
received the name of Cæsarea, one of the towers
on its walls being called Drusus, after the son of
Augustus. Herod did not even hesitate to erect a
Roman temple on the soil of the Holy Land. Two
colossal figures were raised in Cæsarea, one of them
representing, in gigantic proportions, the figure of
Augustus as the Olympian Jupiter, and the other
that of the city of Rome as the Argive Juno. At
the splendid consecration of Cæsarea, the rebuilding
of which had occupied twelve years, the inhabitants
could have imagined themselves transported into
a pagan city. On account of its name, its origin
and its importance, the national party justly called it
Little Rome. In later days it became the seat of the
Roman governor, the rival of Jerusalem, and finally
her conqueror. Whenever Cæsarea rejoiced, Jerusalem
was sure to mourn. The harbor of Cæsarea,
which grew in time to be a town itself, was called
Sebastus. Herod had, without doubt, enhanced the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
beauty of Judæa, but, like a doomed victim, she was
garlanded for the altar. His love of display found
satisfaction in the magnificence of his edifices, but
not his love of renown. Despairing of securing the
affection of his own people, he resolved to compel
the admiration of the stranger. He exhausted his
people by taxation, redoubled his extortions, searched
for hidden treasures in the ancient royal cemeteries,
sold those who had been imprisoned for theft as
slaves to neighboring countries, and then lavished
all the funds he had gained by these practices upon
the adornment of Syrian, Asiatic, and Greek cities.
Huge were the sums of money that he withdrew
from his own country for such enterprises.</p>

<p>Herod may possibly have secured the admiration
and affection of the Greeks, the Romans and the
Judæans outside of Palestine; but the people of
Jerusalem felt nothing but aversion for this grasping
upstart, who sought to estrange them from the
customs of their fathers. In spite of his having shown
himself to be their generous benefactor, upon the
occasion of a great famine (24), the nation now only
beheld in him the murderer of the Hasmonæans, the
usurper of their throne, the destroyer of the noblest
citizens, the suppressor of freedom. He had disgraced
the three dignities of Monarch, High Priest,
and Synhedrist. The first he had arrogated to
himself; the second, which until his reign had, with
very few exceptions, descended by right of inheritance
from father to son, he had given away, according
to his own pleasure or to attain his own ends; and
the power of the third he had curtailed by allowing
it hardly any scope for action. Joshua, of the
family of Phabi, had, through Herod's instrumentality,
succeeded Ananel as High Priest; but the
king having been fascinated by the beauty of another
Mariamne, the daughter of an inferior priest, Simon,
he dispossessed Joshua of his dignity, and raised
Simon to his office, in order that his future wife's
rank be not too strikingly below his own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
This High Priest Simon was an Alexandrian, the
son of Boëthus, and it was he who laid the foundation-stone
of the greatness of the house of Boëthus,
from which several high priests descended. He
appears to have been the founder of the sect of the
Boëthuseans, who followed the teachings of the
Sadducees, but who were better able to grasp and
apply those teachings than the Sadducees themselves,
thanks to their Alexandrian readiness and
sophistry.</p>

<p>These despotic acts of Herod were not calculated
to make him beloved by his people. He was perfectly
aware of their ill-will towards him, but as he
could not crush it, he at least sought to make it
harmless. Thus he insisted upon all subjects taking
an oath of allegiance, resolving to punish severely
those who would refrain from doing so. The Essenes
alone, who disapproved of oaths, were exempt; he
had no cause for fear in their peaceful, contemplative
lives; on the contrary, he warmly approved
of such subjects, who would submit without murmuring
to any law that he might choose to make.
Those amongst the Pharisees who were the followers
of the peace-loving Hillel seem to have taken the
required oath without hesitation, but the followers
of the sterner Shammai stubbornly refused to do so.
Six thousand Pharisees in all refused to take the
oath of allegiance, and to inflict corporal punishment
upon so great a number appeared, even to Herod, a
serious matter. So he heavily taxed the refractory,
amongst whom was the wife of his brother Pheroras,
an ardent devotee, strange to say, of strict Phariseeism.</p>

<p>But, in spite of all these precautionary measures,
Herod did not trust his subjects, and employed a
number of spies to watch them. He himself would
often appear in disguise at their popular assemblies,
and woe to the unfortunate individual who, at that
moment, might be giving utterance to a complaint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
against the existing order of things; he was doomed
to be imprisoned in a fortress, or secretly despatched.
But popularity is too sweet for the tyrant
to forego it, and to Herod it was particularly important,
as he wished to appear before the Romans
in the character of a prince beloved by his people.
This, besides his passion for building, was probably
the motive that impelled him to convert the Temple,
now five hundred years old, small and of an old
fashion, into a magnificent edifice in a new style.
The representatives of the nation, when he informed
them of his plan, received the news with horror;
they feared that Herod intended merely to destroy
their old Temple, and that he would endlessly protract
the work of the new building, thus robbing
them entirely of their sanctuary. But he pacified
them by the assurance that the old Temple should
remain standing until all the workmen, with their
material, were at hand for the construction of the
new one. Thousands of carts, laden with quarry
stone and marble, now appeared on the scene, and
ten thousand skilled workmen were ready to commence
operations. In the eighteenth year of Herod's
reign (20) the building was begun, and in one year
and a half (18) the inner part of the Temple was
finished. The building of the outer walls, courts
and galleries occupied a period of eight years, and
long after this time, until just before the destruction,
the workmen were still employed upon them.</p>

<p>The Herodian Temple was a magnificent production,
the exquisite beauty of which those who
witnessed it could not sufficiently admire. It differed
from the uncompleted Temple of Zerubbabel in
being of vaster dimensions and of richer and more
ornate decoration. The whole circumference of the
Temple Mount (Har-ha-bayith), which was surrounded
by a lofty and strong wall, besides the
fortress at Antonia, with which it was in communication,
exceeded three-quarters of a mile, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
ground rose in terraces. Owing to this commanding
position the Sanctuary could be seen from afar.
The long range of outer wall protected a series of
courts and galleries, with their cedar ceilings and
mosaic floorings. The first court was assigned as a
place of assembly for the people, where the most
important questions were discussed. Here the pagan
and the unpurified were admitted; here Greek and
Roman inscriptions, in large characters, and placed
in prominent positions, caught the eye of him who
entered. They ran as follows: "No foreigner is
permitted to pass through this grating into the
Sanctuary and its surroundings. If discovered there
he has brought the punishment of death upon himself."
The second court, which in former days had
been protected by a wooden grating, was now shut
in by a low wall. The internal arrangements of the
Temple were but little changed, and consisted, as
in the Temple of Zerubbabel, of three uncovered
courts and of the Sanctuary, which was of a size to
admit of the golden altar, the candlestick and the
shewbread table, and, at the extreme end, of the
Holy of Holies. But the outer parts of the Sanctuary
vastly outshone those of the old Temple. Its
walls were of snow-white marble, and as they rose
on the highest summit of the Temple Mount, and
towered above the outer walls and their fortifications,
they presented a beautiful and striking appearance
from all sides. The large space in front of
the Sanctuary was partitioned into various smaller
courts for the use of the women, the laymen, the
priests, and for all those who were engaged in preparing
the sacrifices for the altar. The space allotted
to the female portion of the worshipers, whose
visits to the Temple were now of frequent occurrence,
was entirely shut off from the rest, and three
large balconies were reserved for the use of the
women, from which they were able to witness all
celebrations of a public character. The gateway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
leading to this part of the Temple was closed by
a magnificent door, cast in Corinthian brass, the gift
of a rich and pious Alexandrian, after whom it was
named the Gate of Nicanor. Fifteen steps led
thence to the laymen's quarters, which were reached
by passing through a gateway, called, on account of
its commanding position, the High Gate. The outer
court was entirely open; but, on the other hand, the
Sanctuary was shut off by a gateway higher and
broader than any other, containing double folding
doors, thickly covered with a layer of gold. This
was the Great Gate or the Gate of the Sanctuary.
The high roof of the Sanctuary rose at intervals
into sharp gilded points, the object of which was to
prevent the birds from building their nests on this
consecrated place, but probably quite unintentionally
on the part of the builder, they may also have
served as lightning conductors.</p>

<p>The splendor of the dedication far exceeded that
solemnized in King Solomon's time. Hecatombs
upon hecatombs were offered up, and the whole
nation was feasted. The celebration fell upon the
very anniversary of the day when, twenty years previously,
Herod, with blood-stained hands, had made
himself master of Jerusalem&mdash;a terrible reminiscence.
The hands that built the Temple had already
lighted the torch for its destruction. Herod placed
it under the protection of Rome. To the horror of
the pious Judæans, a golden eagle, the symbol of
Roman might, was hung over the principal entrance.
Herod, moreover, constructed a subterranean passage,
leading from the fortress of Antonia to the
east gate of the Temple, in order to control the
egresses of the Sanctuary. His soul was filled with
distrust of his people.</p>

<p>Towards the close of his reign the aged and sin-laden
monarch was seized with a terrible malady.
This threw him into a condition of such hopeless
misery that one may say that all human feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
gave place to the fury of the wild beast. The
corpses of his innocent victims rose up before his
excited imagination, and made his life one long
torment. Vainly he sought for one loving heart,
one faithful soul, who would comfort and guide him.
But he believed that his own flesh and blood&mdash;his
sister and brother, Salome and Pheroras, even his
own children&mdash;were his enemies, and were conspiring
against his peace and his life. This terrible
state of mind made him more dangerous than ever
to those who ventured within his presence. The
chief cause of his frenzy was the death of his beloved
Mariamne. Besides two daughters, she had
left him two sons, Alexander and Aristobulus, who,
as they grew to man's estate, took the death of their
unfortunate mother deeply to heart, and could not
conceal the aversion they felt for their father. As
these princes were of Hasmonæan descent, Herod
had decided upon making them his successors. He
had sent them as youths to Rome, in order that they
might gain the favor of Augustus, and be educated
according to Roman fashion. He married the
eldest, Alexander, to Glaphyra, the daughter of
Archelaus, King of Cappadocia, and the younger,
Aristobulus, to Salome's daughter, Berenice. He
thought that by these means he could secure peace
amongst the members of his own family. But his
wishes were defeated by the hatred that the revengeful
Salome and her brother Pheroras bore to the
descendants of the Hasmonæan Mariamne. Herod
was induced by his sister to take to his heart and to
adopt as a royal prince the son of his first wife,
Doris, whom together with her child he had repudiated
upon his marriage with Mariamne.</p>

<p>Antipater, the son of Doris, had inherited all the
malice, craft and cruelty of the Idumæans, and he
spared neither his father nor his brothers. The
three, Salome, Pheroras, and Antipater, although
they hated one another mortally, were united in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
hatred against the sons of Mariamne. The more
these princes were indulged by their father, and the
more they were beloved by the people as descendants
from the Hasmonæans on their mother's side,
the more did their bitter foes fear and detest them.
Antipater accused Alexander and Aristobulus of
wishing to avenge the death of their mother upon
the person of their father. Imprudent expressions,
hastily uttered in moments of irritation, may have
given some show of reason to these accusations.
Herod's suspicions dwelt eagerly upon this calumny.
He began to hate his sons, and, as a mark of displeasure
towards them, led Antipater to believe
that he should share in their rights of succession.
This determination of the king served to embitter
the Hasmonæan princes still more, and drove them
to the most unwise outbursts of anger against their
father. Antipater succeeded at the same time in
laying proofs of an attempted conspiracy of the two
brothers against Herod before him. Their friends
and their servants were, by the king's commands,
put to the torture, and upon the strength of their
confession, wrung from them under agony, Alexander
and Aristobulus were condemned to death by a
council numbering one hundred and fifty of Herod's
friends. Herod himself hastened the execution, and
ordered the two princes to be torn from Jerusalem
and hurried to Samaria, and there, where thirty
years previously their unnatural father had celebrated
his marriage with their mother, her two sons
were mercilessly beheaded.</p>

<p>However, the conspiracies against Herod's life
did not cease with their death, but, on the contrary,
acquired fresh vigor. Antipater, not feeling at all
sure of his succession so long as his father was alive,
actually conspired with Pheroras against the life of
that father and benefactor. But his fiendish design
came to light, and it was discovered that Antipater
had undoubtedly intended poisoning his father.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
This disclosure was a terrible blow for Herod.
The turmoil of his outraged feelings cannot be
described, and yet he had to control himself, and
even to pretend great affection for Antipater, in
order to induce that prince to leave Rome and
return to Jerusalem. Upon Antipater's arrival, his
father loaded him with reproaches, and accused him
before a tribunal, which was under the presidency
of the Roman governor Quintilius Varus, of fratricide
and attempted parricide. Vainly did the prince
plead innocence; Herod's friend, Nicolaus of Damascus,
appeared as his merciless accuser. His
death sentence was passed, and Herod begged of
Augustus to ratify it.</p>

<p>Such constant and frequent alarms brought
Herod, who had nearly reached his seventieth year,
to his death-bed. All his hopes were frustrated;
the result of so much labor, of so much guilt, of so
much bloodshed, had become hateful to him. In
which of his surviving sons could he have confidence?
For the third time he altered the succession, and
resolved that the throne should belong to his
youngest son, Antipas I.</p>

<p>His miserable state of mind, which might have
made him gentler and more merciful, only led him
into still greater cruelty. An unimportant rising on
the part of some hot-headed youths called forth
from the aged monarch an act of retaliation as
heartless and as severe as in the days when his
heart beat high with young and ambitious hopes.
The Pharisees were no friends of his, especially
those who were the disciples of Shammai. He
therefore kept a suspicious eye upon the members
of the Pharisaic schools, and the Pharisees, on their
side, continued to incite the youths of their following
against their monarch, whom they termed
the Idumæan and the Roman. This they were
able to do without incurring any danger to themselves,
for they clothed their words in a metaphorical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
garb, applying the denunciations of the Hebrew
prophets of old to the Idumæan nation, to express
what they felt for Herod and his family.</p>

<p>Amongst the Pharisees who were most bitterly
opposed to Herod and the Romans, Judah ben
Zippori and Matthias ben Margalot were distinguished
for their ardor and recklessness, and were
endeared to their people by these very characteristics.
Upon hearing of Herod's mortal illness,
they incited some of their young disciples to put an
end to the desecration of the Temple, by hurling
the Roman eagle from the gateway. The rumors
of Herod's death, that were credited in Jerusalem,
favored this bold undertaking. A number of youths
armed with axes rushed to the Temple Gate, scaled
it by means of a rope-ladder, and cut down the
eagle. At the news of this rebellious action, the
captain of the Herodian guard sent his troops to the
spot, and they succeeded in capturing the two ringleaders
and forty of their followers. They were
brought into the king's presence, and the sight of
these new victims revived his exhausted vitality.
At their trial, which was conducted in his presence,
he was forced to hear much that proved how
incapable he had been in breaking the stubborn
will of his people. The prisoners fearlessly confessed
what they had done, boasting proudly of their
performance, and replying to the question as to who
had incited them to such an action, "The Law."
They were all burnt alive as "desecrators of the
Temple."</p>

<p>But Herod was to be punished more effectually
by eternal justice than would have been possible
had he been arraigned before the severest earthly
tribunal. Even the pleasure that was granted him
before he entirely succumbed to his loathsome
malady, the delight of being able to order the execution
of his son, was soon followed by a paroxysm
of pain in which he nearly caused his own destruction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
His relative Achiab tore the knife from his
hand, but the cry of horror that arose from his
palace in Jericho at this suicidal attempt, came to
the ear of Antipater, a prisoner in the same palace.
He began to hope that his life might yet be spared,
and he besought his gaoler to release him. But
the gaoler, who feared to risk his own life, hurried
into the king's apartments, to see if the cruel
monarch still lived. When Herod heard that
Antipater yet hoped to outlive him, he ordered his
instant assassination, and his orders were forthwith
obeyed. Although Antipater deserved his
death tenfold, yet there was a general feeling of
horror at the idea of a father who could sentence
his three sons to death. Even Augustus, who did
not show any tenderly paternal feelings to his
daughter Julia, could not help exclaiming at the
news of Antipater's execution, that "he would
rather be Herod's swine than his son." A legend
of later date tells how Herod was not satisfied
with shedding the blood of his own children, but
how, in a passion, he ordered all children under two
years of age in Bethlehem and the surrounding
country to be massacred, because he had heard
that the Messiah of the House of David had been
born in that place! But Herod, criminal as he
was, was innocent of this crime.</p>

<p>Herod's last thoughts dwelt, however, upon
bloodshed. He insisted upon the most respected
men of Judæa being brought to Jericho, and imprisoned
in the great public arena, where they were
closely guarded; he then left orders with his sister
Salome and her husband that directly after his
death had taken place they should be all massacred
by his body-guard, so that the entire nation
might be mourning their loved ones, and no one
would have the heart to rejoice over his demise.
Murder filled his thoughts from the first moment of
his public life until he drew his last breath. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
died five days after the execution of Antipater, in
the sixty-ninth year of his life and the thirty-seventh
of his reign, in the spring of the year 4 <span class="smcap smaller">B.&nbsp;C.</span> His
flatterers called him "Herod the Great," but the
nation only knew him as "the Hasmonæan slave."
Whilst his body was being taken in all pomp to its
resting-place in Herodium, under the escort of the
Thracian, German and Gallic body-guard, the
nation joyfully celebrated the day as a semi-festival.</p>

<p>However unfortunate the reign of Herod may
have been, it yet contrasted favorably with that
which followed. Herod's rule was at all events distinguished
by external splendor, and by a certain
amount of animation in the direction of public
affairs. The boundaries of Judæa now extended
far beyond the limits assigned to them in the most
prosperous days of the Hasmonæans. Those tracts
of land beyond the Jordan and the Hermon, which
Aristobulus I and Alexander I had only partially
conquered after years of useless fighting, fell into the
possession of Herod merely by the stroke of a pen;
but the new territories were less welcome, perhaps,
on that account than if they had been won with
toil and difficulty. The towns of Judæa had been
restored with great magnificence, they were adorned
with beautiful specimens of Greek sculpture and
architecture; but the monuments which were
erected perpetuated the fame of Roman dignitaries
and the Herodian family, and not the greatness of
the nation. The seaports, and especially the port
of Cæsarea, were crowded with shipping, and trade
was consequently encouraged, but the imports
which naturally increased did not help to enrich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
the nation. The Temple was resplendent in its
renovated glory, and outwardly recalled the days
of Solomon, but the priests were forced to offer
sacrifices for the welfare of those whom they hated
in their hearts. The country even enjoyed a certain
amount of independence, for the Roman fetters
were not visible at a superficial glance. All this
outward show&mdash;because it was only outward show&mdash;disappeared
with the death of the one man who
knew how to make use of it. As soon as death
had torn the reins from Herod's hands, public affairs
fell into an unsettled and disjointed state, which was
the beginning of more lasting misfortunes. The
edifice, superficially constructed, soon gave way,
burying among its ruins everything that remained
in Judæa of freedom and national existence.</p>

<p>Herod had left several daughters and six sons.
Some of them he favored in his will, others he
slighted. The publication of this will (the contents
of which were known to Ptolemy, the brother
of the celebrated historian, Nicolaus of Damascus)
proved how little he cared for the interests of
Judæa, and how constantly he was actuated by
the most selfish motives. Instead of keeping the
unity of the country intact, he dismembered it, so
as to subdivide it between three of his sons. The
other three were not mentioned; these were&mdash;Herod,
his son by the second Mariamne; another
Herod, by Cleopatra of Jerusalem; and Phasael, by
his wife Pallas. He bequeathed to his son Archelaus
(whose mother was Malthace the Samaritan)
the countries of Judæa and Samaria, with the title
of sovereign. Herod Antipas (also the son of Malthace)
became the possessor of the lands of Galilee
and Peræa; Philip, the son of Cleopatra of Jerusalem,
another tetrarchy&mdash;Gaulanitis, Batanæa, Trachonitis,
and the country called Panias, which contained
the source of the Jordan. He bequeathed to his
sister Salome, as a reward for her faithfulness, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
revenues of the towns of Jamnia, Azotus, and Phasaelis
(to the north of Jericho). However, these last
bequests were only expressed in the form of wishes,
for he left to the emperor Augustus the right of
deciding whether they should be put into execution,
or whether the land should be otherwise divided,
and another successor appointed to the throne.</p>

<p>The sons, who had received but scanty proofs of
affection from their father during his lifetime, were
not united by any ties of brotherly love, and each
envied the share which had fallen to his brother.
Antipas grudged the large territories and the regal
title of Archelaus, because in an earlier will he had
been nominated as successor to the throne. Salome,
in spite of her large possessions, was equally
embittered against Archelaus, and did all in her
power to dispute the succession. The discord
which divided the house of Herod was handed
down to their children and children's children. As
the fulfilment of Herod's bequests depended on a
higher authority, all the disputants tried to ingratiate
themselves with the people, who, they hoped,
would intercede in their favor with Augustus. Salome
and her husband actually countermanded an
order given by Herod for the execution of the imprisoned
nobles, and persuaded the officers of the
Herodian body-guard that Herod himself had disapproved
of an execution on so large a scale.</p>

<p>Archelaus, who had still more causes for currying
favor with the people, appeared in the Court of the
Temple after the period of mourning had expired,
and addressing the multitude from a throne erected
for the occasion, promised to abolish all the unjust
laws sanctioned in his father's reign, and to resettle
public affairs, so as to promote general peace and
well-being. Emboldened by so much condescension,
the people would not rest contented with royal
promises; they insisted upon stating their grievances
in a definite form, and demanded speedy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
certain redress. There were five points on which
the people were particularly resolute. They desired
that the oppressive yearly taxes should be
reduced, whilst the duties upon public sales and
purchases should be completely taken off; that the
prisoners who had languished for years in dungeons
should be liberated; that the counselors who had
voted the death-sentence when the Roman eagle
had been destroyed be punished; and finally that
the unpopular High Priest, Joaser, should be deposed,
and one more worthy of his important office
be named in his stead.</p>

<p>All this was really nothing short of demanding
both a new and a popular form of government and
a public condemnation of the Herodian tyranny.
However little Archelaus cared at heart for the
reputation of his father, he could not possibly agree
to all these requests. Nevertheless, he assented to
everything, but he could not promise that their
wishes should be accomplished until Herod's will
had received the imperial sanction. But the crowds
of people, consisting of several thousands, who had
congregated from every part of Judæa to celebrate
the Feast of Passover, incited by the Pharisees, who
worked upon their feelings by picturing to them the
martyrdom of Judas and Matthias, the destroyers
of the eagle, would not be put off, and came forward
full of anger and defiance. What their intentions
may have been is not known. Archelaus, who
feared a revolt, sent a troop of soldiers to quell any
disturbance, but they were assailed with stones and
forced to take to flight. In the meantime midday
approached, and the people allowed their anger to
cool. They were occupied with the rites of the festivals,
and made no preparations either for defense
or for commencing hostilities. Archelaus took advantage
of their inactivity; he commanded all the
infantry in Jerusalem to fall upon the sacrificing
multitude, and to hew them down; the cavalry were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
to remain in the open plains to arrest the fugitives.
Three thousand were killed on that day on the
Mount of the Temple and in the surrounding country;
those that escaped the sword of the enemy
destroyed themselves. Heralds thereupon proclaimed
to the whole town that Archelaus forbade
the celebration of the Passover for that year, and no
one was allowed to approach the Temple. This
was the inauguration of the reign of Archelaus.</p>

<p>Although his relatives would probably not have
acted with more humanity than he did, they cried
out against his cruelty, and made use of it as a
weapon with which to serve their own purposes
when in the presence of Augustus. The whole
house of Herod traveled to Rome to lay the land
of Judæa at the feet of the emperor, and to petition,
according to their respective interests, for the alteration
or the confirmation of the will.</p>

<p>During their absence unexpected events took
place, and the prize for which they were all contending
very nearly escaped their possession altogether.
Judæa became a huge battle-field, the arena of furious
encounters. Men threw themselves into the
affray, assuming the titles of kings or leaders of the
people. The blood of the slain warriors, the groans
of unarmed, wounded citizens, the smoke issuing
from burning cities, filled every heart with dismay
and with horrible forebodings of the downfall of
Judæa. The tragical events which took place during
the first year after the death of Herod are
described in the Chronicle as the "War Period of
Varus," the Governor of Syria.</p>

<p>At the desire of Archelaus, Quintilius Varus had
remained in Jerusalem after the departure of the
Herodian family, so as to crush any attempt at revolt
which might occur during the absence of the princes.
The task was an easy one, for the patriots who were
hostile to the Herodians had no decided plan of
action, were insufficiently armed, and allowed themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
to be led away by their fierce hatred into
unwise and useless demonstrations. Varus, seeing
no further necessity for remaining in the Judæan
capital, returned to Antioch, but he left a considerable
number of troops to be in readiness in case of
any signs of hostility.</p>

<p>As soon as the governor Varus had left Jerusalem
another cause of annoyance was given to the people
by the arrival of Sabinus, the treasurer of Augustus.
He had been sent to claim the treasures of Herod,
and probably also all those belonging to the Temple,
as if the emperor had been the acknowledged heir
to Herod's possessions. Sabinus must have had
some malevolent intention, for he hastened his
journey to Jerusalem, notwithstanding that he had
promised Varus to remain at Cæsarea until the Herodian
disputes were settled. He took advantage of
the reluctance with which the custodians complied
with his demands to create a disturbance among
the people, and thus obtain a pretext for entering
the city.</p>

<p>The Feast of Pentecost was drawing near, and,
as usual, multitudes of people congregated from all
parts of the country at Jerusalem. This time, the
greater part of them were animated by hostile feelings
against the Romans and the Herodians. The
strife was not delayed. The people soon chose
their leaders, and succeeded in occupying the
Mount of the Temple and the Hippodrome, whence
they defied the Romans, who had taken up their
quarters in the palace of Herod. Sabinus, thinking
himself lost, encouraged the Romans to besiege
the Temple, and sent messages to Varus for more
reinforcements. The Judæans, well protected behind
the Temple walls, hurled their weapons and
their huge stones down upon the Romans. Victory
would have been theirs had not the enemy, with
burning materials, set fire to the colonnade. The
flames spread so rapidly that escape was impossible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
Of the unfortunate combatants, some were
victims of the fire, others fell before the swords of
the Romans, and many of them killed themselves
in reckless despair.</p>

<p>As soon as the Temple was left unprotected, the
Romans, tempted by the treasures which they knew
it contained, rushed into the courts. Sabinus alone
is said to have appropriated four hundred talents
from the treasures of the Temple. The plunder
of these treasures, the desecration of the Holy of
Holies, and the destruction of the halls of the
Temple, barely ten years after the sacred edifice had
been completed, roused all the indignation and,
at the same time, all the valor of the Judæans.
Even a great part of the Herodian troops went over
to the malcontents, and assisted them against the
Romans. Thus strengthened, they besieged the
palace of Herod, laid mines under the towers, and
threatened the Romans with destruction if they did
not retire immediately. Sabinus, anxiously awaiting
the expected reinforcements, but vacillating between
fear of the besiegers and a longing to obtain the
mastery over them, remained for the time in the
citadel of the palace.</p>

<p>Thus all the horrors of anarchy were let loose in
Judæa. Had the insurgents found skilful and trustworthy
leaders their united efforts might have
brought about such momentous events that the
Herodian dispute would have come to a most unexpected
termination. But there was no organization
to give shape and purpose to all this patriotic
fervor. It was nurtured by selfish adventurers, and
was therefore hurtful to the country itself rather than
dangerous to the enemy. Two thousand soldiers,
probably Idumæans, whom Herod had dismissed
shortly before his death, disturbed the regions of the
south. A certain Simon, a slave of Herod, distinguished
by great beauty and an imposing presence,
collected a troop of malcontents, who hailed him as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
their king, and, at his command, burned to the
ground many royal castles in the country, including
the royal palace at Jericho. The palace of Betharamata
was destroyed by a band of men, the name
of whose leader is unknown. A third adventurer
was a shepherd named Athronges, a giant in strength
and stature, who was accompanied into the field of
battle by four brothers, all of the same colossal
build. After assuming the royal title, he fell upon
the Romans, cut off their retreat, and fought valiantly
till, after a long and fierce struggle, he was forced
to yield. There was but one leader of all these free
troopers who had a decided aim in view, and who
might have proved a formidable foe, both to Romans
and Herodians, had fortune favored him, or his
countrymen given him their cordial help. This was
Judas, known by the name of "the Galilean," a native
of Gamala in Gaulanitis, and a son of Ezekias, fighting
against whom Herod had won his first laurels. Judas
had been imbued, from his birth, with a passionate
love for his country, and as passionate a hatred
towards the Romans. He became the leader of a
faction which gradually came to rule the country, and
eventually gave the Romans more difficulties to contend
with than even the Gauls and the Germans.
Judas was at this period in the prime of life. His
intense zeal proved contagious, and he gained a considerable
number of partisans among the powerful
Galileans. With their assistance he took possession
of the arsenal in Sepphoris, the Galilean capital.
He then armed his followers, gave them stipends
from the money found in the arsenal, and soon
became the terror of the Romans and of all those
who were favorably disposed towards them.</p>

<p>Events in the region bordering on Syria were
even more pressing than Sabinus in urging the governor
to suppress the revolt, and to hasten to the
rescue of the Roman troops. The terror of Varus
himself was so great that he not only ordered all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
Roman troops that were at his disposal (over twenty
thousand men) to march against the insurgents, but
summoned the armies under the command of the
neighboring princes. Aretas, the king of the Nabathæans,
placed his troops at the command of the
Roman general, and as they formed the vanguard
of the Roman army, they burnt and plundered all
the villages through which they passed. Varus sent
one division of his troops to Galilee to commence
operations against Judas. There seems to have
been a severe struggle at the town of Sepphoris;
ultimately Varus set fire to it and sold the inhabitants
as slaves, but Judas escaped. The town
of Emmaus, where Athronges had established himself,
shared the same fate, though the inhabitants
had taken to flight. On his arrival at Jerusalem,
Varus found that his task had become a light one,
for the besiegers were alarmed at the report of the
approach of his army, and had abandoned their
struggle against Sabinus. Notwithstanding this,
two thousand prisoners were crucified at the command
of Varus.</p>

<p>Such was the end of a revolt which had been
fanned into existence by a natural feeling of anger
and indignation, but had failed through the absence
of wise and judicious guidance. It had only been
successful in bringing the nation into a state of more
humiliating dependence upon Rome, for a legion
was retained to keep guard over the rebellious citizens
of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>During all this time the Herodians were still discussing
their claims to the sovereignty of Judæa
before the throne of Augustus, and their servile behavior
and mutual accusations only convinced the
Emperor how unworthy one and all were of holding
the reins of government. Before Augustus could
come to any decision, a Judæan embassy arrived,
consisting of fifty men of position and importance,
whose mission had been approved by Varus. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
brought accusations against the Herodian government,
and implored the Emperor to proclaim
Judæa a Roman province in conjunction with Syria,
but to grant the nation full liberty to conduct her
own internal affairs. As the petition had the support
of eight thousand Roman-Judæans, the Emperor
was obliged to listen to it. However, after
having heard both the demands of the embassy and
the arguments of the pretenders to the throne, he
decided upon confirming Herod's will, with this
exception, that he did not grant the sovereignty
immediately to Archelaus, but only recognized him
as ruler (Ethnarch), promising him, however, that if
he proved worthy of the royal title it should be
granted to him eventually. Augustus could not
entirely disregard the last wishes of a prince who
had been his friend, and who had served the Romans
with a devotion only equaled by the zeal with
which he furthered his own egotistical ends. The
imperial treasury suffered no diminution whether
Judæa was called an ethnarchy or a province
dependent upon Rome.</p>

<p>The reign of Archelaus was short and uneventful
(4 <span class="smcap smaller">B.&nbsp;C.</span>&ndash;6 <span class="smcap smaller">C.&nbsp;E.</span>). Herod's children had inherited
little of their father's disposition, excepting his fancy
for building and his cringing policy towards Rome.
In other respects they were insignificant, and there
was something small and contemptible even in their
tyranny. At first Archelaus (who appears also
under the name of Herod) attempted to conciliate
the discontented members of the community, whose
indignation he had aroused at the assembly in the
courts of the Temple. He gave way to the general
desire to depose the unpopular High Priest Joasar,
and appointed in his stead the latter's brother,
Eleazer, who was soon succeeded by Joshua of the
family of Sié or Seth. But he in turn was replaced
by Joasar, and thus three High Priests followed
one another in the short space of nine years.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
The only war carried on by Archelaus was fought
against Athronges, who had been able to hold his
own for some time after the death of his four
brothers; and such was the incapacity of Archelaus
that he was long unable to subdue an adventurer,
whose powers were almost exhausted, but who was
still able to dictate the conditions of his own surrender.</p>

<p>Archelaus offended the feelings of the pious
Judæans by his marriage with his sister-in-law
Glaphyra, the widow of Alexander, who had been
executed. This daughter of the king of Cappadocia
had had two sons; one of these, Tigranes,
and his nephew of the same name, became, in later
years, kings respectively of Greater and Lesser
Armenia. Indifferent to the melancholy fate of her
husband, she married, after his death, Juba, the king
of Numidia; but was soon divorced from him, and
contracted an alliance with Archelaus, the brother
of her first husband, an alliance forbidden by
Judæan laws. Little is known of the life of Archelaus;
his acts of tyranny called forth the opprobrium
of the Judæans and the Samaritans. He
was taken before Augustus to answer for his
misdeeds, but being unable to defend himself, he
was dethroned and sent into exile among the Allobrogian
races (6 <span class="smcap smaller">C.&nbsp;E.</span>). The principalities belonging
to Herod Antipas and to Philip remained in
their former condition, but the towns which had
been in the possession of Salome came also under
the Imperial sway, for Salome had bequeathed them
at her death to the Empress Livia.</p>

<p>Thus after enjoying a hundred and fifty years of real
or apparent independence, Judæa became entirely
subjugated to Roman authority, and was united with
the province of Syria. Matters remained in this condition,
with the exception of a short interval, till the
final revolt. The Imperial representative in Judæa,
who henceforth received the title of Procurator, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
his seat of government in the seaport Cæsarea, which
from that time became the hated rival of Jerusalem.
The duties of the Procurator consisted in maintaining
order in the country, and in enforcing the punctual
payment of all taxes. He had even the power
of pronouncing the death sentence, and also of
supervising the Synhedrion's administration of the
criminal law.</p>

<p>The authority of the Synhedrion became more
and more limited, and the political importance of
that assembly, which had considerably diminished
during the reign of Herod, dwindled entirely away.
The Romans interfered in all the functions of the
Synhedrion, and also in the installations of the
High Priests. The Procurator named and deposed
the High Priests according to their friendly
or unfavorable inclinations towards Rome; he took
charge of the sacerdotal ornaments, and only gave
them up on the chief festivals. The vestments of
the High Priests were kept under lock and key in
the fortress of Antonia; they were removed in time
for the festival by the officials of the Temple, and
returned to their place of preservation in the presence
of a Roman overseer. A light was burning
constantly before the case containing the priestly
vestments.</p>

<p>The first Procurator whom Augustus sent to
Judæa was the captain of the horse, Coponius. The
Syrian Governor, Quirinius, came at the same time
(6&ndash;7) to lay claim to the confiscated property of
Archelaus. He was also instructed to take a census
of the population, and to estimate the property of
the country for the purpose of the new method of
taxation. A tax was to be levied upon every individual,
inclusive of women and slaves; however,
female children under twelve and male children
under fourteen years of age and very old people
were to be exempt. Furthermore, an income tax
was levied, and those who kept cattle were called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
upon to give up a part of their herds. The taxes
on the land were to be paid out of the produce of
the harvest.</p>

<p>This method of levying imposts roused the indignation
of all classes alike. Every one resented
such interference in private as well as political
affairs, and felt as if the land and property, and the
very person of each individual were in the hands of
the emperor, and made use of according to his
pleasure. It is not surprising that, in their ignorance
of the Roman constitution, the people should
have looked upon the census as the herald of slavery,
and anticipated with terror a repetition of the Babylonian
captivity. Their dread of the census, exaggerated
perhaps, but not wholly unjustifiable, caused
greater agitation than any previous statute, and
aroused new disputes, in which the old differences
between Pharisee and Sadducee were entirely forgotten.
New points of discussion were raised. The
question of the supremacy of the oral law disappeared
before the burning question of the day&mdash;whether
the people should become slaves to the
Romans, or whether they should offer stubborn and
energetic resistance. This question brought dissension
into the camp of the Pharisees. The new
faction to which this discussion on the census had
given rise sprang from the very center of the
Synhedrion, and was connected with the names of
Hillel, Shammai, and Judas of Galilee.</p>

<p>Hillel and Shammai did not live to see the
catastrophe which made Judæa a province of Rome.
Hillel's death caused wide-spread mourning, and the
oration at his grave began with the sad cry: "O
pious, O gentle, O worthy follower of Ezra." The
people, in their great affection for him, continued to
distinguish his descendants with their favor, and the
presidency of the Synhedrion became hereditary in
his family for more than four centuries. Of Hillel's
son and successor, Simon I, nothing but his name has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
been preserved. All the greatness which encircled
Hillel's name was bequeathed to the school which
he formed, and which inherited and faithfully preserved
the spirit of its founder. The disciples of
this school evinced in all their public dealings the
peacefulness and gentleness, the conciliatory spirit
which had distinguished their great master. They
were guided and supported by these characteristic
qualities during the political storms which long
convulsed their unhappy country. There were
about eighty members of this school who were
most devotedly attached to Hillel, and were called
the elders of the school. The names of only two
of these have been recorded: Jonathan, the son
of Uziel, and Jochanan ben Zaccai. The former is
reputed, but without actual proof, to have been the
author of a Chaldaic translation of the Prophets.
He was disinherited by his father in favor of
Shammai, probably from displeasure at his having
joined the school of Hillel.</p>

<p>In the same way as the school of Hillel endeavored
to preserve the characteristic gentleness of
their master, the followers of Shammai emulated
and even exceeded the stern severity of the founder
of their school. It seemed impossible to the school
of Shammai to be sufficiently stringent in religious
prohibitions; the decisions which they arrived at,
in their interpretations of the law, were so generally
burdensome that those which were milder in
character were treasured up as rare exceptions.
Thus, according to their opinion, no work should be
attempted which, if commenced before the Sabbath,
would, even without the aid of a Judæan,
be completed on the Sabbath. It was prohibited
on the Sabbath day to give sums of money for
charitable purposes, to make arrangements for
marriage contracts, to instruct children, to visit the
sick, or even to bring comfort to the sorrowing. In
their regulations concerning the purity of the Levites<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
in their person and apparel, their exaggerations
brought them very near the excesses of the Essenes.
They were equally severe concerning matrimonial
laws, and only allowed divorce to be granted in the
case of the unchastity of the wife.</p>

<p>In the school of Shammai, the Pharisaic principles
were carried to the very extreme. It was only due
to the yielding disposition of the followers of Hillel
that peace was not disturbed, and that a friendly
relationship existed between two schools of such
opposite views and characters. The school of
Shammai were not only severe in their explanations
of the laws, but entertained very stern and rigid
opinions on nearly all subjects; they were particularly
harsh and repellant towards proselytes to
Judaism. Any heathen who came to the school of
Shammai, requesting to be received into the community
might expect but a very cold and repellant
reception. The school of Shammai cared not for
proselytes. How dangerous to Judaism lukewarm
proselytes may be, they had too often seen in the
case of the converted Herodians. But in spite
of their own rigid obedience to the Law, they did not
exact the same obedience from the Judæan troops
who were fighting against the national enemy.
Originally there had been some hesitation about
making war on the Sabbath, but now the school of
Shammai were unreservedly in favor thereof; the
siege of a hostile city, commenced before the Sabbath,
was not to be raised, in spite of the transgressing
of the Sabbath law, until the fortress surrendered.
These ordinances were instituted by Shammai himself,
in whom hatred of the heathen was even
greater than religious devotion. The school of
Shammai had a large number of adherents in the
Synhedrion, as well as among the people. Their
religious austerity, and their hatred of the heathens,
found more sympathizers than the moderation and
peacefulness of the followers of Hillel. They consequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
formed the majority, and were able to
carry all their resolutions. Among the followers of
Shammai, several names have been preserved&mdash;Baba
ben Buta, Dostai from Itome, and Zadok.</p>

<p>It is possible that this Zadok may be the same
of whom it is related that, excited by a fanatical
hatred of the Romans, he joined with Judas the
Galilean, and placed himself at the head of a religious
republican faction who called themselves the
<i>Zealots</i> (Kannaim). The members of this faction
were also called the Galileans. The watchword
which Judas gave the party of the Zealots, and
which was eagerly endorsed by Zadok, was that
obedience to the Roman law was disregard of the
Divine law, for God alone was ruler, and could
alone demand obedience; that it became, therefore,
a clear and solemn duty to strain every nerve, and
sacrifice property, and life, and family in this struggle
against the usurper, who exacted submission
due to God alone. And they set up as an exemplar
Phineas, the slayer of the chief Zimri, the only
one who, in the presence of a neglectful tribe and
a slothful nation, had served his God with zeal.
Furthermore, Judas proclaimed that the Judæan
state must be a republic, recognizing God alone
as sovereign and His laws as supreme. This
teaching found favor all the more readily as the
Roman yoke was becoming more and more intolerable.
The great purpose they had in view&mdash;the
recovery of their freedom&mdash;electrified young and
old, and the Zealots, a faction which at first only
comprised followers of Shammai, soon included a
great number of Judæans, who chafed indignantly
under the weight of the Roman fetters.</p>

<p>As soon as the law was passed that every one
should give an accurate description of his family,
his lands and his property, Zadok and Judas gave
the signal for energetic resistance. In some
places a conflict seems to have ensued. The more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
moderate, however, including the High Priest
Joasar, tried to pacify the malcontents by explaining
that the census would not be the precursor of
slavery or of the confiscation of property, but was
simply necessary in order to control the arrangements
for taxation. It was useless, and the census
was regarded with such suspicion and dislike
that every fine was now called census (Kenas).
Even the moderate party, although they endeavored
to stem the agitation, were indignant at the
encroachments made upon their liberties. The
school of Hillel considered the taxation so unjustifiable
that, conscientious as they were, they acceded
to all measures by which it might be escaped.</p>

<p>Such was the general abhorrence for this system
of taxation, that all those who were officially occupied
in carrying it out, whether as tax-collector
(Moches) or as treasurer (Gabbai), were looked
upon as dishonorable men; they were not tolerated
in the higher ranks of the community, and their testimony
as witnesses was discredited. Only mercenary
motives and utter indifference to public
opinion could induce any one to undertake the despised
office. The designations of tax-gatherer and
overseer became henceforth terms of opprobrium.</p>

<p>Another change also originated with the Roman
occupation of Judæa. All public documents,
deeds of divorce, etc., were now to be dated
according to the year of the reign of the Roman
Emperor, and not, as formerly, that of the Judæan
rulers. The Zealots were much annoyed at this
innovation, and they accused the more moderate
Pharisees, who had yielded to it, of indifference in
matters of religion. "How could such an ignominy
be perpetrated as to write the words, 'according to
the laws of Moses and Israel'" (the usual formula
in the separation deeds) "next to the name of the
heathen ruler, and thus permit the holy name of the
greatest prophet to be placed by the side of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
name of the heathen ruler." In one matter Quirinius
was forced to yield to the wishes of the
people. He deposed the unpopular High Priest
Joasar, and named in his stead Anan of the family
of Seth, whose four sons also became high priests.</p>

<p>Under Coponius, who entered upon his office
of Procurator when Quirinius left, the old enmity
between the Judæans and Samaritans revived.
Several days before the Feast of Passover, the
doors of the Temple were thrown open at midnight,
on account of the great number of offerings
which took place during that time. A few Samaritans
stole into the first outer court, and threw some human
bones in among the pillars, with the object of polluting
the Temple. Henceforth the hatred between
these two races became fiercer than ever, and the
guards of the Temple, who were under the charge
of the Levites, were strengthened, so as to prevent
the recurrence of such a desecration. Not long after
these events Coponius was recalled. He was followed
by Marcus Ambivius, who in a short time was
also recalled, and was succeeded by Annius Rufus.
Thus there were three overseers in the short space
of seven years (7&ndash;14), a disastrous circumstance, as
each one was intent upon draining, as far as possible,
all the wealth from the nation.</p>

<p>The death of Augustus brought little change to
Judæa; the latter simply became, with other provinces,
the possession of Tiberius. Outwardly, these
provinces may not have suffered under the new emperor's
reign, for he was just to the people, though
antagonistic to the aristocracy, which he endeavored
to suppress. He listened to the complaints of the
Judæans, and lightened the burdens of their almost
unendurable taxation. He appointed as procurator
Valerius Gratus, who occupied this post for eleven
years (15&ndash;26) In reality, however, the antipathy
of Tiberius to the Judæans was even greater than
that of his predecessor and adopted father; it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
seem as if the representative of imperialism in
Rome had a foreboding of the mortal blow which
Rome was destined to receive from Judaism. This
antipathy had probably been stimulated by the fact
that the Romans, and particularly the Roman
women, had a leaning towards Judaism. The enthusiasm
of the Judæans for their religion presented a
striking contrast to the indifference with which the
Romans, both the priests and the laity, regarded their
national worship. The loss of freedom in imperial
Rome had carried away with it that ideality which
inspires highly-gifted souls; ardent and emotional
minds sought in vain for some lofty interest to satisfy
their longings. Several Roman proselytes, during
the reign of Tiberius, gave evidence of their religious
enthusiasm by sending offerings to the Temple
at Jerusalem. It may have been a feeling of superstition,
rather than conviction, which gave rise to
conversions; for from the converts gained for the
cult of Isis in Rome, it was evident that the unknown,
the strange, the mystical exercised a strong fascination
over those from whose lives all idealism was
banished.</p>

<p>The displeasure of Tiberius was incurred by the
Roman proselytes for the first time under the following
circumstances:&mdash;Fulvia, the wife of a very highly
respected senator, had been converted to Judaism,
and had sent offerings to the Temple through the
agency of her teachers, who, however, had retained
these offerings for themselves. As soon as these
facts came to the ears of Tiberius, he presented a
law against Judæans to the Senate. That body
consequently resolved that Judæans must leave the
city of Rome, on pain of becoming slaves for life,
unless they abjured Judaism within a given time.
This measure is said to have been urgently recommended
by the minister Sejanus, who exercised a
most powerful influence over Tiberius. Thousands
of Judæan youths were, then and there, banished to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
Sardinia, to fight against the hordes of brigands that
infested that island. Banishment to so uncongenial
a climate was almost certain to be fatal to the
unfortunate youths; but this consideration did not
lead the Emperor, as hard-hearted as his senators,
to take a milder course. The Judæans throughout
Italy were threatened with banishment if they did
not forsake their religious observances; all young
men, in the prime of life, were forced to come
armed into the camp on the Sabbath-day; severe
punishment followed if religious scruples dictated
a refusal. This was the first time that the Judæans
had suffered religious persecution in Rome&mdash;their
first martyrdom&mdash;destined to be the precursor of
countless others.</p>

<p>The Procurator Gratus, whom Tiberius had appointed,
took as active a part as his predecessors in
the internal affairs of Judæa. During the eleven
years that he occupied his post he installed as many
as five high priests, of whom some only retained
their office during one year. These changes were
sometimes due to the unpopularity of the high
priests, but were far more often the result of bribery
or of wanton arbitrariness.</p>

<p>Although Judæa and the neighboring lands of
Idumæa and Samaria were ruled by Procurators,
the tetrarchy of Galilee and Peræa enjoyed a semblance
of independence under the reign of Herod
Antipas, and the lands of Batanæa and Trachonitis
under that of Philip. These two princes were distinguished
only for their passion for building and
their submissiveness to Rome. Herod Antipas had
at first made Sepphoris the capital of his tetrarchy,
but as soon as Tiberius became emperor he built
a new city in the lovely neighborhood of the lake of
Gennesareth, which he named Tiberias, and where
he established his court (24&ndash;26). But the pious
Judæans objected to living in this new city; it had
probably been built upon a site which had once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
served as a battle-field, as a quantity of human bones
were discovered there. The inhabitants were consequently
prevented by the strict Levitical regulations
from visiting the Temple, and performing various
religious observances. Antipas induced the
Judæans to settle there only by holding out the
most tempting offers and by using force; and a century
actually elapsed before the more conscientious
members of the people consented to take up their
abode in the city of Tiberias.</p>

<p>The town of Beth-Ramatha, in a situation similar
to that of Jericho, and also rich in the produce of
balsam plants, was renamed Livia, in honor of the
wife of Augustus. Philip, whose revenue from the
country only amounted to one hundred talents,
also built two cities. One of these he built in the
beautiful district near the source of the Jordan, and
named it Cæsarea Philippi, to distinguish it from the
seaport town of Cæsarea; the other, to the northeast
of the Lake of Gennesareth, he named Julias, after
the daughter of Augustus. Indeed, Judæa teemed
with monuments erected in honor of the Cæsars.
Philip's disposition was gentle, and seemingly unmarred
by fierce passions, and his reign, which
lasted seven-and-thirty years (4 <span class="smcap smaller">B.&nbsp;C.</span>&ndash;33 <span class="smcap smaller">A.&nbsp;C.</span>), was
quiet and uneventful. Antipas, on the contrary, had
inherited some of his father's wild and bloodthirsty
nature.</p>

<p>The successor to the Governor Valerius Gratus
was Pontius Pilate, whose tenure of office (26&ndash;36)
embraced a decade memorable in the history of the
world. As soon as he was in power, he showed the
determination to subject the Judæans to further
humiliation, and to convince them that they must
drink the cup of suffering to the dregs. The
mere facts that Pilate was the creature of the deceitful
minister Sejanus, before whom emperor and
senate trembled alike, and that he was sent by him
to Judæa, would suffice to describe his disposition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
Pilate was worthy of his master; he certainly went
far beyond any of his predecessors in wounding the
susceptibilities of the Judæan nation. He attacked
their religious scruples by endeavoring to induce
them to pay homage to the emblems and insignia
of imperialism. Till now the leaders of Roman
troops had respected the aversion with which the
Judæans were known to regard all images, and on
entering Jerusalem the obnoxious emblems had
always been removed from the Roman standards.
Herod and his sons had never failed to observe this
practice. Although Pilate well knew that the feelings
of Judæans had never before been outraged on
this subject, he paid no heed to them. It is not
known whether he had received secret injunctions
on this point from Sejanus, or whether he acted on
his own authority, with the anticipation of a satisfactory
bribe. He sent privately for all the imperial
emblems in order to replace them upon the standards
which were in Jerusalem. The command that
these representations of human beings were to be
worshiped as deities caused the deepest indignation
throughout the land. Delegates from the people,
who were even joined by members of the Herodian
family, hastened to the Procurator at Cæsarea, and
implored him to command the removal of the hated
images.</p>

<p>During five days the petitioners remained before
the palace of the Procurator, sending up ceaseless
supplications. On the sixth day Pilate attempted
to terrify them, and threatened that they should be
cut down by his legions if they did not immediately
disperse. However, when he found that the
Judæans were determined to sacrifice their lives, if
necessary, rather than their religious convictions,
and perhaps afraid of the disapproval of Tiberius,
he at last gave way, and issued a command that the
cause of their anger should be removed. But he
provoked the indignation of the inhabitants of Jerusalem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
against himself a short time after. He
purposed making an aqueduct from a spring at a
distance of four geographical miles from the town
of Jerusalem. In order to meet the necessary expenses,
he possessed himself of the treasures in the
Temple (the korban). He was in Jerusalem at the
time, and was surrounded by an angry populace,
who assailed him with execrations. He did not
venture to call out his legions, but ordered a number
of soldiers to disguise themselves in the Judæan
dress, and to mingle with the crowd and attack
them. The multitudes rapidly dispersed, but not
before great numbers of them had been killed and
wounded.</p>

<p class="center bpad">28&ndash;37 <span class="smcap smaller">C.&nbsp;E.</span></p>

<p>While Judæa was still trembling in fear of some
new act of violence on the part of the governor,
Pontius Pilate, which would again afflict the country
with disturbances and troubles, a strange event
occurred. At first but little heeded, it soon acquired,
through the singularity of its origin and
many favorable attendant circumstances, a considerable
degree of notoriety. So great were the
strides this movement rapidly made to influence
and power, that radical changes were produced by
it and new paths opened in the history of the world.
The time had come when the fundamental truths of
Judaism, till then thoroughly known and rightly appreciated
only by profound thinkers, were to burst
their shackles and go freely forth among all the people
of the earth. Sublime and lofty views of God and
of holy living for the individual as well as for the
state, which form the kernel of Judaism, were now
to be disseminated among other nations and to bring
them a rich and beneficent harvest. Israel was now
to commence in earnest his sacred mission; he
was to become the teacher of nations. The ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
teaching about God and religious morality was to
be introduced by him unto a godless and immoral
world. Judaism, however, could gain admission
into the hearts of the heathens only by taking
another name and assuming new forms, for with its
old designation and distinctive features it was not
generally popular.</p>

<p>It was due to the strange movement which arose
under the governorship of Pilate that the teachings
of Judaism won the sympathy of the heathen world.
But this new form of Judaism, altered by foreign
elements, became estranged from and placed itself
in harsh antagonism to the parent source. Judaism,
which had given birth to this new manifestation,
could take no pleasure in her offspring, which soon
turned coldly from her and struck out into strange,
divergent paths. This new power, this old doctrine
in a new garb, or rather this Essenism intermingled
with foreign elements, is Christianity, whose advent
and earliest course belong to the Judæan history of
this epoch.</p>

<p>Christianity owed its origin to an overpowering,
mysterious feeling which reigned among the better
classes of the Judæan nation, and which became
daily stronger as their political position became
more and more intolerable. The ever-recurring
evils brought on them by the rapacity of their
Roman rulers, the shamelessness of the Herodian
princes, the cowardice and servility of the Judæan
aristocracy, the debasement of the high priests
and their families, and the dissensions of rival parties,
had raised the longing for the deliverer announced
in the prophetical writings&mdash;the Messiah&mdash;to
so great a pitch that any highly-gifted individual,
possessed of outward charm or imbued with moral
and religious grace, would readily have found disciples,
and believers in his Messianic mission. The
most earnest thinkers of that time had long regarded
the political condition of the Judæans since their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
return from the Babylonian exile as a temporary
or preparatory state, which would only continue
until the true prophet arose, and Elijah turned
the hearts of the fathers to the children, and restored
the tribes of Jacob. When the people, with solemn
rites, elected the Hasmonæan Simon as their prince,
they decreed that he and his descendants should
hold that position only until the True Prophet appeared
to assume the royal dignity, and it was only
to a scion of the House of David, the Anointed
that, according to prophecy, this dignity by right
belonged.</p>

<p>When, consequent upon the wars undertaken by
the three powerful leaders, Octavius, Antony, and
Lepidus, ostensibly to punish Cæsar's murderers,
in reality to introduce a new form of government,
the great political convulsion took place in the
Roman Empire, and three divisions of the world
were laid waste, a Judæan poet in Egypt was foretelling
a far different outcome&mdash;the destruction of
the whole heathen world and the dawn of the
"Kingdom of God." In that kingdom a holy king&mdash;the
Messiah&mdash;would hold the scepter. "When
Rome shall vanquish Egypt, and govern her, then
shall the greatest in the kingdom, the immortal
King, arise in the world, and a holy King will come
to rule over all the nations of the earth during all
time." The Messiah, so confidently expected, was
to bring forth quite a new state of things&mdash;a new
heaven and a new earth. At the coming of Elijah,
who was to be the precursor of the Messiah, the
resurrection of the dead would take place, and a
future world be revealed.</p>

<p>This ardent longing for the Messiah, and the
belief in his advent, swayed all classes of the Judæan
nation, excepting the aristocracy and those who
clung to Rome. These were satisfied with the
present, and anticipated harm rather than benefit
from any change. During the short space of thirty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
years a great number of enthusiastic mystics appeared,
who, without any intention to deceive, and
bent upon removing the load of care and sorrow
that weighed so heavily upon the people, assumed
the character of prophet or Messiah, and found disciples,
who followed their banner faithfully unto death.
But though it appears that every Messiah attracted
ready believers, no one was acknowledged as such by
the whole nation. The incessant friction between
the various communities, and the deep study of the
holy books, had awakened a critical spirit difficult to
satisfy. The nation was also split into many parties,
each entertaining a different idea of the future savior,
and rendering it, therefore, impossible that any one
aspirant should receive general recognition as the
Messiah. The republican zealots, the disciples of
Judas of Galilee, pictured the Messiah as delivering
Israel from his enemies by the breath of his mouth,
destroying the Roman Empire, and restoring the
golden era of David's kingdom. The school of
Shammai added to this representation of the Messiah
the attributes of ardent religious zeal and perfect
moral purity. The followers of Hillel, less
swayed by fanaticism or political views, expected a
prince of peace, who would bring tranquillity to the
country itself, and introduce harmony into its relations
with all its neighboring states. On one point,
however, all agreed: the Messiah must spring from
the branch of David; and thus, in the course of time,
the expression "Ben David"&mdash;the son of David&mdash;became
identical with the Messiah. According to the
prevailing belief, the fulfillment of the Messianic
prophecies required the return of the scattered tribes
of Israel, richly laden with presents, expiatory offerings
from the nations by which they had so long been
oppressed. Even the most educated classes, who had
felt the influence of Grecian culture, and were represented
by Philo, the Judæan Plato, fully believed
that the Messianic age was to be ushered in, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
pictured it as an epoch of miracles. A heavenly
apparition, only visible to the righteous, would lead
back from Greece and barbarous lands the exiled
and repentant Israelites. The latter would be found
prepared for the Messianic time, following the holy
life of the patriarchs, and imbued with a sublime and
pious spirit, which would prevent them from falling
into their old sins, and would surely call down upon
them the full grace of God. Then would the streams
of former happiness be again replenished from the
eternal spring of Divine grace: the ruined cities
would arise, the desert become a blooming land,
and the prayers of the living would have the power
of awakening the dead.</p>

<p>It was the sect of Essenes that pictured the Messiah
and the Messianic time in the most idealistic
manner. The great object of their asceticism
was to advance the kingdom of heaven (Malchuth
Shamayim) and the coming era (Olam-ha-Ba). Their
adherence would be granted alone to him who led a
pure and spotless life, who renounced the world
and its vanities, and gave proofs that the Holy
Spirit (Ruach ha-Kodesh) dwelt within him. He
must also have power over demons, reject Mammon,
and inaugurate a system of community of goods, in
which poverty and self-renunciation would be the
ornaments of mankind.</p>

<p>It was from the Essenes that for the first time the
cry went forth, "The Messiah is coming! The
kingdom of heaven is near!" He who first raised
his voice in the desert little thought it would re-echo
far away over land and sea, and that it would be
answered by the nations of the earth flocking
together round the banner of a Messiah. In announcing
the kingdom of heaven, he only meant to
invite the sinners among the Judæan people to penitence
and reformation. The Essene who sent forth
this call to the Israelites was John the Baptist (his
name doubtless meaning the Essene, he who daily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
bathed and cleansed both body and soul in spring
water). But few accounts have reached us of John
the Baptist. He led the same life as the Essenes,
fed upon locusts and wild honey, and wore the garb
of the prophets of old, a cloak of camel-hair fastened
by a leather girdle. John appears to have fully
entertained the belief, that if only the whole Judæan
nation would bathe in the river Jordan, acknowledge
their sins, and adopt the strict rules of the Essenes,
the promised Messianic time could be no longer
deferred. He therefore called upon the people to
come and receive baptism in the Jordan, to confess
and renounce their sins, and thus prepare for the
advent of the kingdom of heaven.</p>

<p>John dwelt with other Essenes in the desert, in the
vicinity of the Dead Sea, presumably in order to be
ever at hand to teach the repentant sinners the
deep moral signification of baptism. Bound up
with that rite was doubtless the adoption of the
rule of life of the Essenes. There were certainly
many, imbued with an enthusiastic spirit, and saddened
by the evils and the distress they witnessed, who
eagerly responded to the cry of the Essene Baptist.
Who would not gladly, were it only in his power to
do so, further the great work of the Redemption,
and help to advance the kingdom of heaven? Did
the baptized persons return improved by their immersion
in the waters of the Jordan? Was any
great moral influence the result of this symbolical
act? History tells us not; but our knowledge of
the state of Judæa at that time can easily supply
us with an answer to the question. The Judæan
people did not as a whole, especially among the
middle-class citizens, require this violent shock
as a means of improvement; they were neither
vicious nor depraved, and their form of public religious
worship was sufficient to keep them in the right
paths. By two sets of people, however, the call of
John to repentance might have been heeded&mdash;it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
might have had a beneficial influence upon the higher
and lower classes, upon the aristocracy and wealthy,
who had been corrupted by Rome, and upon the miserable
peasantry, brutalized by constant warfare. But
the rich only laughed at the high-souled enthusiast,
who taught that baptism in the water of the Jordan
would bring about the miraculous Messianic era, and
the sons of the soil were too obtuse and ignorant to
heed the Baptist's earnest cry.</p>

<p>His appeal, on the other hand, had nothing in its
tenor and character to offend the Pharisees, or
arouse any opposition among the ranks of that
ruling party. John's disciples, those who were
bound closest to him, and who carried out his mode
of living, kept strictly to the words of the Law, and
observed all its prescribed fasts. If the Pharisees,
comprising at that time the schools of Hillel and of
Shammai, did not greatly favor the enthusiasm and
extravagance of the Essenes, they placed themselves
in no direct antagonism to the Baptists.</p>

<p>From their side, John would have met with no
hindrance to his work, but the Herodians were suspicious
of a man who drew such throngs around
him, whose burning words moved the hearts of his
hearers in their very depths, and could carry away
the multitude to the performance of any enterprise
he chose to undertake. Herod Antipas, governor
of the province in which the Baptist dwelt, gave his
soldiers orders to seize and imprison him. How
long a time he was kept in confinement, and
whether he was still alive when one of his disciples
was being proclaimed as the Messiah, must, on
account of the untrustworthiness of the sources
from which our information is derived, remain
doubtful. It is authentic, however, that he was beheaded
by the order of Antipas, whilst the story of
the young daughter of Herodias bringing to her
mother the bloody head of the Baptist upon a platter
is a mere legend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
After the imprisonment of the Baptist, his work
was carried on by some of his disciples, among
whom no one exerted so powerful an influence as
Jesus of Galilee. Jesus (short for Joshua), born in
Nazareth, a small town in Lower Galilee, to the
south of Sepphoris, was the eldest son of an otherwise
unknown carpenter, Joseph, and of his wife
Miriam or Mary, who bore him four more sons,
Jacob, Josê, Judah, and Simon, and several daughters.
Whether Joseph or Mary, the father and
mother of Jesus, belonged to the family of David
cannot be proved. The measure of his mental
culture can only be surmised from that existing in
his native province. Galilee, at a distance from the
capital and the Temple, was far behind Judæa in
mental attainments and knowledge of the Law.
The lively interchange of religious thought, and the
discussions upon the Law, which made its writings
and teachings the common property of all who
sought the Temple, were naturally wanting in
Galilee. The country, which, at a later period, after
the destruction of the Temple, contained the great
schools of Uscha, Sepphoris, and Tiberias, was at
that time very poor in seats of learning. But, on
the other hand, morality was stricter in Galilee, and
the observance of laws and customs more rigidly
enforced. The slightest infringement was not
allowed, and what the Judæans permitted themselves,
the Galilæans would by no means consent
to. They were also looked upon as fanatical dogmatists.</p>

<p>Through their vicinity to the heathen Syrians, the
Galilæans had adopted many superstitions, and,
owing to their ignorance of the nature of disease,
the sick were often thought to be possessed by demons,
and various forms of illness were ascribed to
the influence of evil spirits. The language of the
Galilæans had also become corrupted by their
Syrian neighbors, and was marred by the introduction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
of Aramaic forms and words. The Galilæans
could not pronounce Hebrew with purity. They
exchanged, and sometimes omitted, the guttural
sounds, and thus often incurred the ridicule of the
Judæans, who thought a great deal of correct articulation.
The first word he spoke revealed the Galilæan,
and, as his language provoked laughter, he
was not often allowed to lead in the recital of the
prayers. The birthplace of Jesus, Nazareth, offered
no particular attraction; it was a small mountain-town,
not more fertile than the other parts of
Galilee, and bearing no comparison to the richly-watered
Shechem.</p>

<p>On account of his Galilæan origin, Jesus could
not have stood high in that knowledge of the Law
which, through the schools of Shammai and Hillel,
had become prevalent in Judæa. His small stock
of learning and his corrupt half-Aramaic language
pointed unmistakably to his birthplace in Galilee.
His deficiency in knowledge, however, was fully
compensated for by his intensely sympathetic character.
High-minded earnestness and spotless moral
purity were his undeniable attributes; they stand
out in all the authentic accounts of his life that have
reached us, and appear even in those garbled teachings
which his followers placed in his mouth. The
gentle disposition and the humility of Jesus remind
one of Hillel, whom he seems, indeed, to have taken as
his particular model, and whose golden rule, "What
you wish not to be done to yourself, do not unto
others," he adopted as the starting-point of his
moral code. Like Hillel, Jesus looked upon the
promotion of peace and the forgiveness of injuries as
the highest forms of virtue. His whole being was
permeated by that deeper religiousness which consecrates
to God not only the hour of prayer, a day
of penitence, and longer or shorter periods of devotional
exercise, but every step in the journey of life,
which turns every aspiration of the soul towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
Him, subjects everything to His will, and, with
child-like trust, commits everything to His keeping.
He was filled with tender brotherly love, which
Judaism also teaches towards an enemy, and had
reached the ideal of the passive virtues which the
Pharisees inculcated: "Count yourself among the
oppressed and not among the oppressors, receive
abuse and return it not; do all from love to God,
and rejoice in suffering." Jesus doubtless possessed
warm sympathies and a winning manner,
which caused his words to produce a deep and
lasting effect.</p>

<p>Jesus must, from the idiosyncrasies of his nature,
have been powerfully attracted by the Essenes, who
led a contemplative life apart from the world and
its vanities. When John the Baptist&mdash;or more correctly
the Essene&mdash;invited all to come and receive
baptism in the Jordan, to repent and prepare for
the Kingdom of Heaven, Jesus hastened to obey
the call, and was baptized by him. Although it
cannot be proved that Jesus was formally admitted
into the order of the Essenes, much in his life and
work can only be explained by the supposition that
he had adopted their fundamental principles. Like
the Essenes, Jesus highly esteemed self-inflicted
poverty, and despised the mammon of riches. The
following proverbs, ascribed to him, appear to bear
his stamp: "Blessed are ye poor, for yours is the
kingdom of heaven" (Luke vi. 20). "It is easier
for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than
for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God"
(Matthew xix. 24). "No man can serve two masters,
ye cannot serve God and mammon" (Matthew
vi. 24). Jesus shared the aversion of the Essenes to
marriage: "It is not good to marry" (Matthew xix. 11).
Community of goods, a peculiar doctrine of the
Essenes, was not only approved of, but positively enjoined
by Jesus; like them, he also reprobated every
form of oath. "Swear not at all" (so Jesus taught),
"neither by heaven nor by the earth, nor by your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
head&mdash;but let your yea be yea, and your nay be nay"
(James v. 12). Miraculous cures, said to have been
performed by him&mdash;such as the exorcism of demons
from those who believed themselves to be possessed&mdash;were
often made by the Essenes, so to say, in a
professional capacity.</p>

<p>After John had been taken and imprisoned by
Herod Antipas, Jesus thought simply of continuing
his master's work; like him, he preached "Repent,
for the kingdom of heaven is at hand," without
perhaps having then a suspicion of the part he
was afterwards to play in that kingdom of heaven
looked forward to in the approaching Messianic
time. Jesus apparently felt that if his appeal
was not to be lost in the desert like that of the
Baptist, but, on the contrary, bring forth lasting
results, it must not be addressed to the whole
nation, but to a particular class of the Judæans.
The middle classes, the inhabitants of towns of
greater or lesser importance, were not wanting in
godliness, piety and morality, and consequently a
call to them to repent and forsake their sins would
have been meaningless. The declaration made to
Jesus by the young man who was seeking the way
of eternal life, "From my youth upwards, I have
kept the laws of God; I have not committed murder,
nor adultery, nor have I stolen, nor borne false
witness; I have honored my father and mother,
and loved my neighbor like myself,"&mdash;this declaration
might have been made by the greater number
of the middle-class Judæans of that time. The
disciples of Shammai and Hillel, the followers of the
zealot Judas, the bitter foes of the Herodians and of
Rome, were not morally sick, and were not in need
of the physician's art. They were ever ready for
self-sacrifice, and Jesus wisely refrained from turning
to them. Still less was he inclined to attempt to
reform the rich, and he was repelled by the higher
classes of Judæans. From these, the warning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
of the simple, unlearned moralist and preacher, his
reproof of their pride, their venality and inconstancy,
would only have elicited mockery and derision.
With right judgment, therefore, Jesus
determined upon seeking out those who did not
belong to, or had been expelled from the community
for their religious offenses, and who had either not
been allowed or had not desired to return to it.
They were publicans and tax-gatherers, shunned by
the patriots, as promoters of Roman interests, who
turned their backs upon the Law, and led a wild,
unshackled life, heedless alike of the past and of the
future. There existed in Judæa many who had no
knowledge of the great healing truths of Judaism,
who were ignorant of its laws, and indifferent as to
the glorious history of its past or its possible future.
These were known as transgressors of the Law
(Abrianim), or sinners as they were called, the
friends of Herod and of Rome. There were also
ignorant, poor handicraftsmen and menials (Am
ha-Arez), who were seldom able to visit the Judæan
capital, or listen to Judæan teachings, which, indeed,
they would probably not have understood. It was
not for them that Sinai had flamed, or the prophets
had uttered their cry of warning; for the teachers of
the Law, more intent upon expounding doctrine than
upon reforming their hearers, failed to make the Law
and the prophets intelligible to those classes, and consequently
did not draw them within their fold. It was
to these outcasts that Jesus turned, to snatch them
out of their torpor, their ignorance and ungodliness.
He felt within himself the call to save "the
lost sheep of the house of Israel." "They that be
whole need not a physician, but they that are sick"
(Matthew ix. 12).</p>

<p>Intent upon the lofty mission which he had undertaken&mdash;to
turn the ignorant and the godless,
the sinner and the publican to repentance, and by
virtue of the Essene mode of living to prepare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
them for the approaching Messianic time&mdash;Jesus
first sought his native town of Nazareth. But
there, where he had been known from his infancy,
and where the carpenter's son was not considered
to possess superior sanctity but only inferior knowledge,
he was met with derision and contempt.
When, on the Sabbath, he spoke in the synagogue
about repentance, the listeners said to each
other, "Is that not the son of Joseph the carpenter,
and his mother and sisters, are they not all with
us?" and they said to him, "Physician, heal thyself,"
and listened not to him. The ignominious
treatment he received in his own birthplace caused
him to utter the proverb, "The preacher is least
regarded in his own country." He left Nazareth,
never to return.</p>

<p>A better result followed the teaching of Jesus
in the town of Capernaum (Kefar Nahum), which
was situated on the western coast of the Sea of
Tiberias. The inhabitants of that delightfully
situated town differed as much from the Nazarenes
as their mild, fertile land from a rough and wild
mountain gorge. In Capernaum there were doubtless
a greater number of men steeped in effeminacy
and vice, and there existed, probably, a wider gap
between the rich and the poor. But just on that
account Jesus had more scope to work there, and
an easier access was found for the earnest, penetrating
words which he poured forth from the depths of
his soul. Many belonging to the lowest classes attached
themselves to Jesus and followed him. Among
his first disciples in Capernaum were Simon, called
Kephas or Petrus (rock), and his brother Andrew,
the sons of Jonah, both fishermen, the first, in some
degree, a law-breaker, and also the two sons of a
certain Zebedee, Jacob and John. He was also followed
by a rich publican, called sometimes Matthew,
sometimes Levi, in whose house Jesus often tarried,
bringing with him companions from the classes then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
looked down upon with the greatest contempt.
Women likewise of doubtful repute were among
his followers, the most conspicuous of the number
being a native of the town of Magdala, near
Tiberias, Mary Magdalene, from whom seven devils
(according to the language of the time) had to be
driven out. Jesus converted these abandoned sinners
into remorseful penitents. It was, doubtless,
an unheard-of thing at that time for a teacher of
Judaism to hold intercourse with women at all,
more especially with any of that description.</p>

<p>He, however, by word and example raised the
sinner and the publican, and filled the hearts of
those poor, neglected, thoughtless beings with the
love of God, transforming them into dutiful children
of their heavenly Father. He animated them with
his own piety and fervor, and improved their conduct
by the hope he gave them of being able to enter
the kingdom of heaven. That was the greatest
miracle that Jesus performed. Above all things,
he taught his male and female disciples the Essene
virtues of self-abnegation and humility, of
the contempt of riches, of charity and the love of
peace. He said to his followers, "Provide neither
gold nor silver nor brass for your purses, neither
two coats, neither shoes" (Matthew x. 9). He
bade them become sinless as little children, and
declared they must be as if born again if they would
become members of the approaching kingdom of
heaven. The law of brotherly love and forbearance
he carried to the extent of self-immolation. "If
you receive a blow on one cheek, turn the other
one likewise, and if one takes your cloak, give him
likewise your shirt." He taught the poor that they
should not take heed for meat or drink or raiment,
but pointed to the birds in the air and the lilies in
the fields that were fed and clothed yet "they toil
not, neither do they spin." He taught the rich how
to distribute alms&mdash;"Let not thy left hand know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
what thy right hand doeth." He admonished the
hypocrite, and bade him pray in the secrecy of his
closet, placing before him a short form of prayer&mdash;"Our
Father which art in heaven," which may
possibly have been in use among the Essenes.</p>

<p>Jesus made no attack upon Judaism itself, he
had no idea of becoming the reformer of Jewish
doctrine or the propounder of a new law; he sought
merely to redeem the sinner, to call him to a good
and holy life, to teach him that he is a child of
God, and to prepare him for the approaching
Messianic time. He insisted upon the unity of
God, and was far from attempting to change in the
slightest degree the Jewish conception of the
Deity. To the question once put to him by an
expounder of the Law, "What is the essence of
Judaism?" he replied, "'Hear, O Israel, our God
is one' and 'Thou shalt love thy neighbor as
thyself.' These are the chief commandments"
(Mark xii. 28). His disciples, who had remained true
to Judaism, promulgated the declaration of their
Master&mdash;"I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill;
till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle
shall in nowise pass from the Law till all be fulfilled"
(Matthew v. 17). He must have kept the Sabbath
holy, for those of his followers who were attached
to Judaism strictly observed the Sabbath, which
they would not have done had their master disregarded
it. It was only the Shammaitic strictness in
the observance of the Sabbath, which forbade even
the healing of the sick on that day, that Jesus protested
against, declaring that it was lawful to do
good on the Sabbath. Jesus made no objection to
the existing custom of sacrifice, he merely demanded&mdash;and
in this the Pharisees agreed with him&mdash;that
reconciliation with one's fellow-man should precede
any act of religious atonement. Even fasting
found no opponent in him, so far as it was practised
without ostentation or hypocrisy. He wore on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
garments the fringes ordered by the Law, and he
belonged so thoroughly to Judaism that he shared
the narrow views held by the Judæans at that
period, and thoroughly despised the heathen world.
He was animated by that feeling when he said,
"Give not that which is holy unto the dogs,
neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they
trample them under their feet and turn again and
rend you."</p>

<p>The merit of Jesus consists especially in his
efforts to impart greater inner force to the precepts
of Judaism, in the enthusiasm with which he obeyed
them himself, in his ardor to make the Judæans
turn to God with filial love as children to their
father, in his fervent upholding of the brotherhood
of men, in his insistence that moral laws be placed
in the foreground, and in his endeavors to have
them accepted by those who had been hitherto
regarded as the lowest and most degraded of
human beings.</p>

<p>It was not to be expected, however, that through
his teaching alone Jesus could attract devoted
followers, or achieve great results; something
more was required&mdash;something strange and wonderful
to startle and inflame. His appearance, his
mystical character, his earnest zeal produced,
doubtless, a powerful effect, but to awaken in
the dull and cold a lasting enthusiasm, to gain
the confidence of the masses and to kindle their
faith, it was necessary to appeal to their imagination
by strange circumstances and marvelous surroundings.
The Christian chronicles abound in
extraordinary events and descriptions of miraculous
cures performed by Jesus. Though these stories
may in part be due to an inclination to exaggerate
and idealize, they must doubtless have had some
foundation in fact. Miraculous cures&mdash;such, for
example, as the exorcism of those possessed by
demons&mdash;belonged so completely to the personality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
of Jesus that his followers boasted more of the
exercise of that power than of the purity and holiness
of their conduct. If we are to credit the historical
accounts of that period, the people also
admired Jesus more for the command he displayed
over demons and Satan than for his moral greatness.
It was indeed on account of the possession
of such power that he was first considered a supernatural
being by the uncultured masses.</p>

<p>Encouraged by the great effect he produced in
Capernaum, where he found his first circle of disciples,
Jesus wandered about in the towns of Galilee,
remaining some time in its second capital,
Bethsaida, in Magdala, and in Chorazin, where he
gained many followers. His presence, however, in
Bethsaida and Chorazin could not have produced
any lasting result, as he bewailed&mdash;according to the
words placed in his mouth, "Woe unto thee, Chorazin,
woe unto thee, Bethsaida"&mdash;the spirit of
opposition and indocility of their inhabitants. Like
Sodom and Gomorrah, they were accursed. Still
he had many faithful disciples, both men and
women, who followed him everywhere, and obeyed
him in all things. They renounced not only their
former immoral and irreligious life, but also gave
up all their possessions, carrying out the doctrine
of the community of goods. The repasts they
took in common formed, as it were, the connecting
link which attached the followers of Jesus to
one another, and the alms distributed by the rich
publicans relieved the poor disciples of the fear
of hunger, and thus bound them still more closely
to Jesus.</p>

<p>Among his followers Jesus selected as his peculiar
confidants those who, distinguished by their
superior intelligence or greater steadfastness of
character, seemed best calculated to forward the
aims he had in view. The number of these trusted
disciples was not known, but tradition mentions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
twelve, and calls them the twelve apostles&mdash;representatives,
as it were, of the twelve tribes of Israel.</p>

<p>His great design, the secret desire of his heart,
Jesus disclosed on one occasion to the most intimate
circle of his disciples. He led them to a
retired spot at the foot of Mount Hermon, not far
from Cæsarea Philippi, the capital of the Tetrarch
Philip, where the Jordan rushes forth from mighty
rocks, and in that remote solitude he revealed to
them the hidden object of his thoughts. But he
contrived his discourse in such a manner that it appeared
to be his disciples who at last elicited from
him the revelation that he considered himself the
expected Messiah. He asked his followers, "Who
do men say that I, the son of man, am?" Some replied
that he was thought to be Elijah, the expected
forerunner of the Messiah; others, again, that he
was the prophet whose advent Moses had predicted;
upon which Jesus asked them, "But whom say ye
that I am?" Simon Peter answered and said,
"Thou art the Christ." Jesus praised Peter's discernment
and admitted that he was the Messiah,
but forbade his disciples from divulging the truth,
or, for the present, from speaking about it at all.
Such was the mysteriously-veiled birth of Christianity.
When, a few days later, the most trusted
of his disciples, Simon Peter and the two sons of
Zebedee, James and John, timidly suggested that
Elijah must precede the Messiah, Jesus declared
that Elijah had already appeared, though unrecognized,
in the person of the Baptist. Had Jesus
from the very commencement of his career nourished
these thoughts in the depths of his soul, or
had they first taken shape when the many followers
he had gained seemed to make their realization
possible? Jesus never publicly called himself the
Messiah, but made use of other expressions which
were doubtless current among the Essenes. He
spoke of himself as "the son of man," alluding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
probably to Daniel vii. 13, "One like the son of
man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to
the Ancient of Days," a verse which referred probably
to the whole people and its Messianic future,
but which at that time was made to point to the
Messiah himself. There was yet one other name
which Jesus applied to himself in his Messianic
character&mdash;the mysterious words "Son of God,"
probably taken from the seventh verse of the second
Psalm, "The Lord hath said unto me, Thou
art my son; this day have I begotten thee." Was
this expression used by Jesus figuratively, or did
he wish it to be taken in a literal sense? As far as
we know, he never explained himself clearly on
that subject, not even at a later date, when it was
on account of the meaning attached to those words
that he was undergoing his trial. His followers
afterwards disagreed among themselves upon that
matter, and the various ways in which they interpreted
that ambiguous expression divided them into
different sects, among which a new form of idolatry
unfolded itself.</p>

<p>When Jesus made himself known as the Messiah
to his disciples, enjoining secrecy, he consoled them
for the present silence imposed on them by the
assurance that a time would come, when "What I
tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light, and what
ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the house-tops."
What occurred was doubtless contrary to
what Jesus and his disciples expected, for as soon
as it was known (the disciples having probably not
kept the secret) that Jesus of Nazareth not only
came to preach the Kingdom of Heaven, but was
proclaimed as the expected Messiah, the public
sentiment rose against him. Proofs and signs of
his being the Messiah were asked, which he was
not able to give, and he thus was forced to evade
the questions addressed to him. Many of his followers
seem to have been repelled by his assumption<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
of the Messianic character, and so left him at
once. "From that time many of his disciples went
back, and walked no more with him" (John vi. 66).
In order not to be discredited in the eyes of his disciples,
it was essential that he should perform some
miracle that would crown his work or seal it with his
death. It was expected that he would now appear
in Jerusalem before the whole nation in the character
of the Messiah, and it is stated that his own brothers
entreated of him to go there, so that his achievements
might at last become visible to his disciples.
"For there is no man that doeth anything in secret
and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou
do these things, show thyself to the world" (John
vii. 4). Jesus thus found himself almost obliged to
enter upon the path of danger. He was, moreover,
no longer safe in Galilee, and appears to have been
tracked and pursued from place to place by the
servants of the Tetrarch Herod Antipas. It was at
that time that Jesus said to one of his followers who
clung to him in his distress, "The foxes have holes
and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of
Man hath not where to lay his head" (Matthew
viii. 20). He wished to prevent any misconception
as to his desire to alter the Law, and his reply to
the Pharisee who asked what would be required of
him if he became his disciple was, "If thou wilt enter
into life, keep the commandments, sell what thou
hast and give to the poor." When he had passed
Jericho and was approaching Jerusalem, Jesus took up
his abode near the walls of the capital, in the village
of Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, where the lepers
who were obliged to avoid the city had their settlement.
It was in the house of one of these that
shelter was given him. The other disciples whom
he found at Bethany belonged also to the lower
orders. They were Lazarus and his sisters, Mary
and Martha. Only one resident of wealth and position
in Jerusalem, Joseph of Arimathea, is said to
have become a disciple of Jesus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
The entrance of Jesus into Jerusalem and his
appearance in the Temple have been glorified by a
halo of legends which contain but little historical
truth. They show us Jesus accompanied in triumph
by the people singing hosannas, the same people
who a few days later were to demand his death.
Both reports were inventions: the first was designed
to prove that he was recognized as the Messiah by
the people; the second, to throw the guilt of his
execution upon all Israel. Equally unhistorical is
the account of Jesus entering the Temple by force,
throwing down the tables of the money-changers,
and chasing away those who were selling doves.
An act that must have given rise to intense excitement
would not have been omitted from other
chronicles of that period. It is not mentioned in
any other writings of that time that the stalls of
money-changers and dealers in doves had a place
in the Temple.</p>

<p>It is just the most important facts of the life of
Jesus&mdash;the account of the attitude he assumed at
Jerusalem before the people, the Synhedrion and the
different sects, the announcement of himself as the
Messiah, and the manner in which that announcement
was received&mdash;that are represented in such
various ways in the chronicles that it is impossible
to separate the historical kernel from its legendary
exaggerations and embellishments. Prejudice certainly
existed against him in the capital. The
educated classes could not imagine the Messiah's
saving work to be performed by an unlearned
Galilæan; indeed, the idea that the Messiah, who
was expected to come from Bethlehem, out of the
branch of David, should belong to Galilee, overthrew
the long-cherished conviction of centuries. It is
probably from this time that the proverb arose:
"Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?"
(John i. 46). The devout took offense at his going
about eating and drinking with sinners, publicans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
and women of a degraded class. Even the Essenes,
John's disciples, were displeased at his infringement
of rules and customs. The Shammaites were scandalized
at his healing the sick on the Sabbath day,
and could not recognize the Messiah in one who
desecrated the Sabbath. He also roused the opposition
of the Pharisees by the disapproval he
expressed here and there of their interpretations of
the laws, and of the conclusions they drew from
them. From Jesus the zealots could not look for
deeds of heroism, for, instead of inspiring his followers
with hatred of Rome, he advocated peace, and in
his contempt for mammon admonished them to submit
willingly to the Roman tax-gatherers. "Render
therefore unto Cæsar the things which are Cæsar's,
and unto God the things which are God's" (Matt.
xxii. 21). These startling peculiarities, which seemed
to contradict the preconceived idea of the Messianic
character, caused the higher and the learned classes
to be coldly indifferent to him, and it is certain that he
met with no friendly reception in Jerusalem. These
various objections, however, to the mode of life and
the tenets of Jesus afforded no ground for any legal
accusation against him. Freedom of speech had,
owing to the frequent debates in the schools of
Shammai and Hillel, become so firmly established a
right that no one could be attacked for expressing
religious opinions, unless indeed he controverted
any received dogma or rejected the conception of
the Divinity peculiar to Judaism. It was just in this
particular that Jesus laid himself open to accusation.
The report had spread that he had called himself
the Son of God&mdash;words which, if taken literally,
wounded the religious feelings of the Judæan nation
too deeply to allow him who had uttered them to
pass unscathed. But how was it possible to ascertain
the truth, to learn whether Jesus had really
called himself the Son of God, and to know what
meaning he attached to these words? How was it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
possible to discover what was the secret of his sect?
To bring that to light it was necessary to seek a
traitor among his immediate followers, and that
traitor was found in Judas Iscariot, who, as it is
related, incited by avarice, delivered up to the judges
the man whom he had before honored as the Messiah.
One Judæan account, derived from what
appears a trustworthy source, seems to place in the
true light the use made of this traitor. In order to
be able to arraign Jesus either as a false prophet or
a seducer of the people, the Law demanded that
two witnesses had heard him utter the dangerous
language of which he was accused, and Judas
was consequently required to induce him to speak
whilst two hidden witnesses might hear and report
his words. According to the Christian writings, the
treachery of Judas manifested itself in pointing out
Jesus through the kiss of homage that he gave his
master as he was standing among his disciples, surrounded
by the people and the soldiers. No sooner
had Jesus been seized by the latter than his disciples
left him and sought safety in flight, Simon Peter
alone following him at some distance. At dawn of
day on the 14th of Nissan, the Feast of the Passover,
that is to say, on the eve of the Feast of Unleavened
Bread, Jesus was led, not before the great Synhedrion,
but before the smaller court of justice, composed
of twenty-three members, over which the
High Priest, Joseph Caiaphas, presided. The trial
was to determine whether Jesus had really claimed
to be, as the two witnesses testified, the Son of God;
for one cannot believe that he was arraigned before
that tribunal because he had boasted that it was in
his power to destroy the Temple and rebuild it in
three days. Such a declaration, if really uttered by
him, could not have been made a cause of complaint.
The accusation doubtless pointed to the sin of blasphemy,
and to the supposed affirmation of Jesus
that he was the Son of God. Upon the question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
being put to him on that score, Jesus was silent and
gave no answer. When the presiding judge, however,
asked him again if he were the Son of God, he
is said to have replied, "Thou hast said it," and to
have added, "hereafter shall ye see the Son of Man
sitting on the right hand of power and coming
in the clouds of Heaven." If these words were
really spoken by Jesus, the judges could infer that
he looked upon himself as the Son of God. The
High Priest rent his garments at the impious assertion,
and the court declared him guilty of blasphemy.
From the account of the proceedings given by Christian
authorities, there is no proof that, according to
the existing penal laws, the judges had pronounced
an unjust verdict. All appearances were against
Jesus. The Synhedrion received the sanction of the
death-warrant, or rather the permission to execute
it, from the governor, Pontius Pilate, who was just
then present for the festival at Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Pilate, before whom Jesus was brought, entering
into the political side of the question, asked him if
he declared himself to be not only the Messiah but
the King of the Judæans, and as Jesus answered
evasively, "Thou hast said it," he likewise decreed
his execution, which he indeed alone had the power
to enforce. That Pilate on the contrary found
Jesus innocent and wished to save him, while
the Judæans had determined upon putting him
to death, is unhistorical and merely legendary.
When Jesus was scoffed at and obliged to wear the
crown of thorns in ironical allusion to the Messianic
and royal dignity he had assumed, it was not the
Judæans who inflicted those indignities upon him,
but the Roman soldiers, who sought through him to
deride the Judæan nation. Among the Judæans
who had condemned him there was, on the contrary,
so little of personal hatred that he was treated
exactly like any other criminal, and was given the
cup of wine and frankincense to render him insensible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
to the pains of death. That Jesus was scourged
before his execution proves that he was treated
according to the Roman penal laws; for by the
Judæan code no one sentenced to death could
suffer flagellation. It was consequently the Roman
lictors who maliciously scourged with fagots or ropes
the self-styled King of the Judæans. They also
caused Jesus (by the order of Pilate) to be nailed to
the cross, and to suffer the shameful death awarded
by the law of Rome. For after the verdict of death
was pronounced by the Roman authorities, the condemned
prisoner belonged no more to his own
nation, but to the Roman state. It was not the
Synhedrion but Pilate that gave the order for the
execution of one who was regarded as a State criminal
and a cause of disturbance and agitation. The
Christian authorities state that Jesus was nailed on
the cross at nine o'clock in the morning, and that he
expired at three o'clock in the afternoon. His last
words were taken from a psalm, and spoken in the
Aramaic tongue&mdash;"God, my God, why hast Thou
forsaken me?" (Eli, eli, lama shebaktani.) The
Roman soldiers placed in mockery the following
inscription upon the cross: "Jesus of Nazareth,
King of the Judæans." The cross had been erected
and the body was probably buried outside the town,
on a spot which was the graveyard of condemned
criminals. It was called Golgotha, the place of skulls.
Such was the end of the man who had devoted himself
to the improvement of the most neglected, miserable,
and abandoned members of his people, and
who, perhaps, fell a victim to a misunderstanding.
How great was the woe caused by that one execution!
How many deaths and sufferings of every
description has it not caused among the children of
Israel! Millions of broken hearts and tragic fates
have not yet atoned for his death. He is the only
mortal of whom one can say without exaggeration
that his death was more effective than his life. Golgotha,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
the place of skulls, became to the civilized
world a new Sinai. Strange, that events fraught
with so vast an import should have created so little
stir at the time of their occurrence at Jerusalem,
that the Judæan historians, Justus of Tiberias and
Josephus, who relate, to the very smallest minutiae,
everything which took place under Pilate, do not
mention the life and death of Jesus.</p>

<p>When the disciples of Jesus had somewhat recovered
from the panic which came upon them at the
time he was seized and executed, they re-assembled
to mourn together over the death of their beloved
Master. The followers of Jesus then in Jerusalem
did not amount to more than one hundred and
twenty, and if all who believed in him in Galilee had
been numbered, they would not have exceeded five
hundred. Still, the effect that Jesus produced upon
the unenlightened masses must have been very
powerful; for their faith in him, far from fading away
like a dream, became more and more intense, their
adoration of Jesus rising to the highest pitch of
enthusiasm. The only stumbling-block to their belief
lay in the fact that the Messiah who came to deliver
Israel and bring to light the glory of the kingdom of
heaven, endured a shameful death. How could the
Messiah be subject to pain? A suffering Messiah
staggered them considerably, and this stumbling-block
had to be overcome before a perfect and joyful
belief could be reposed in him. It was at that
moment probably that some writer relieved his own
perplexities and quelled their doubts by referring to
a prophecy in Isaiah, that "He will be taken from the
land of the living, and will be wounded for the sins
of his people." The humble, wavering disciples of
Jesus were helped over their greatest difficulty by
the Pharisees, who were in the habit of explaining
the new or the marvelous by interpretations of Scripture.
By this means they afforded indirectly a solution
and support to Christianity, and thus belief was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
given to the most senseless and absurd doctrines,
and the incredible was made to appear certain and
necessary. Without some support, however feeble,
from Holy Writ, nothing new would have been
received or could have kept its ground. By its
help everything that happened was shown to have
been inevitable. Even that Jesus should have been
executed as a malefactor appeared pregnant with
meaning, as it fulfilled the literal prophecy concerning
the Messiah. Was it not written that he should
be judged among the evil-doers? His disciples
declared they had heard Jesus say that he would be
persecuted even unto death. Thus his sufferings
and death were evident proofs that he was the Messiah.
His followers examined his life, and found in
every trivial circumstance a deeper Messianic significance;
even the fact that he was not born in Bethlehem,
but in Nazareth, appeared to be the fulfillment
of a prophecy. Thus he might therefore be called a
Nazarene (Nazarite?), and thus were his followers
persuaded that Jesus, the Nazarene, was Christ (the
Messiah). When the faithful were satisfied on that
point, it was not difficult to answer the other question
which naturally offered itself&mdash;When would the
promised kingdom of heaven appear, since he who
was to have brought it had died on the cross? Hope
replied that the Messiah would return in all his
glory, with the angels of heaven, and then every one
would be rewarded according to his deeds. They
believed that some then alive would not taste death
until they had seen the Son of Man enter his kingdom.
His disciples were hourly expecting the
return of Jesus, and only differed from the Judæans
in so far as they thought that the Messiah had already
appeared in human form and character.</p>

<p>This kingdom was to last a thousand years: the
Sabbath year of jubilee, after the six thousand years
of the world, would be founded by Jesus when he
returned to the earth, bringing the blessing of peace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
and perfect happiness to the faithful. This belief
required the further conviction that Jesus had not
fallen a prey to death, but that he would rise again.
It may have been the biblical story of Jonah's
entombment for three days in the bowels of a fish
which gave rise to the legend that Jesus after the
same interval came forth from his sepulcher, which
was found to be empty. Many of his disciples
declared they had seen him after his death, now in
one place, now in another; that they had spoken to
him, had marked his wounds, and had even partaken
of fish and honey with him. Nothing seemed to
stagger their faith in the Messianic character of
Jesus; but greatly as they venerated and glorified
him, they had not yet raised him above humanity; in
spite of the enthusiasm with which he inspired them,
they could not look upon him as God. They regarded
him only as a highly gifted man who, having obeyed
the Law more completely than any other human
being, had been found worthy to be the Messiah of
the Lord.</p>

<p>They deviated in no degree from the precepts of
Judaism, observing the Sabbath, the rite of circumcision,
and the dietary laws, whilst they also reverenced
Jerusalem and the Temple as holy places.
They were, however, distinguished from the other
Judæans in some peculiarities besides the belief they
cherished that the Messiah had already appeared.
The poverty which they willingly embraced in
accordance with the teaching of Jesus was a remarkable
trait in them. From this self-imposed poverty
they were called Ebionites (poor), a name they
either gave themselves or received from those who
had not joined them. They lived together, and each
new disciple was required to sell his goods and
chattels and to pour the produce into the common
purse.</p>

<p>To this class belonged the early Christians,
or Judæan Christians, who were called Nazarenes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
and not, according to their origin, Essenes. Seven
administrators were appointed, as was usual among
the Judæans, to manage the expenditure of the community,
and to provide for their common repasts.
They abstained from meat, and followed the way of
the Essenes, whom they also resembled in their
practice of celibacy, in their disuse of oil and superfluous
garments, a single one of white linen being
all each possessed. It is related of James, the
brother of Jesus, who, on account of his near relationship
to the founder, was chosen leader of the
early Christian community, and was revered as an
example, that he drank no wine or intoxicating
beverages, that he never ate meat, allowed no scissors
to touch his hair, wore no woolen material, and
had only one linen garment. He lived strictly
according to the Law, and was indignant when the
Christians allowed themselves to transgress it. Next
to him at the head of the community of Ebionites
stood Simon Kephas or Petrus, the son of Jonas, and
John the son of Zebedee, who became the pillars of
Christianity. Simon Peter was the most energetic
of all the disciples of Jesus, and was zealous in his
endeavors to enroll new followers under the banner
of Christianity. In spite of the energy he thus displayed,
he is described as being of a vacillating
character. The Christian chronicles state that when
Jesus was seized and imprisoned he denied him three
times, and was called by his master "him of little
faith." He averred, with the other disciples, that
they had received from Jesus the mission of preaching
to the lost children of the house of Israel the
doctrine of the brotherhood of man and the community
of goods; like Jesus and John the Baptist, they
were also to announce the approaching kingdom of
heaven. Christianity, only just born, went instantly
forth upon her career of conquest and proselytism.
The disciples asserted that Jesus had imparted to
them the power of healing the sick, of awakening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
the dead, and of casting out evil spirits. With them
the practice of exorcism became common, and thus
the belief in the power of Satan and demons, brought
from Galilee, first took form and root. In Judaism
itself the belief in demons was of a harmless nature,
without any religious significance. Christianity first
raised it to be an article of faith, to which hecatombs
of human beings were sacrificed. The early Christians
used, or rather misused, the name of Jesus for
purposes of incantation. All those who believed in
Jesus boasted that it was given to them to drive
away evil spirits, to charm snakes, to cure the sick
by the laying on of their hands, and to partake of
deadly poisons without injury to themselves. Exorcism
became by degrees a constant practice among
Christians; the reception of a new member was
preceded by exorcism, as though the novice had till
then been possessed by the devil. It was, therefore,
not surprising that the Christians should have
been looked upon by Judæans and heathens as conjurors
and magicians. In the first century, however,
Christians attracted but little attention in Judæan
circles, escaping observation on account of the
humble class to which they belonged. They formed
a sect of their own, and were classed with the
Essenes, to whom, in many points, they bore so
great a resemblance. They might probably have
dwindled away altogether had it not been for one
who appeared later in their midst, who gave publicity
to the sect, and raised it to such a pinnacle of
fame that it became a ruling power in the world.</p>

<p>An evil star seems to have shone over the
Judæan people during the hundred years which
had elapsed since the civil wars under the last
Hasmonæans, which had subjected Judæa to Rome.
Every new event appeared to bring with it some
new misfortune. The comforting proverb of Ecclesiastes,
that there is nothing new under the sun,
in this instance proved false. The Messianic vision<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
which had indistinctly floated in the minds of the
people, but which had now taken a tangible form,
was certainly something new; and this novel apparition,
with its mask of death, was to inflict new
and painful wounds upon the nation.</p>

<p>Christianity, which came from Nazareth, was
really an offshoot of the sect of the Essenes, and
inherited the aversion of that sect for the Pharisaic
laws by which the life of the people was
regulated. This aversion rose to hatred in the
followers, stimulated by grief at the death of their
founder. Pontius Pilate had greatly contributed to
increasing of the enmity of the Christians against
their own flesh and blood. He it was who added
mockery and scorn to the punishment of death; he
had bound their Messiah to the cross like the most
abject slave, and in derision of his assumed royalty
had placed the crown of thorns on his head. The
picture of Jesus nailed to the cross, crowned with
thorns, the blood streaming from his wounds, was
ever present to his followers, filling their hearts
with bitter thoughts of revenge. Instead of turning
their wrath against cruel Rome, they made the
representatives of the Judæan people, and by degrees
the whole nation, responsible for inhuman
deeds. They either intentionally deceived themselves,
or in time really forgot that Pilate was the
murderer of their master, and placed the crime
upon the heads of all the children of Israel.</p>

<p>At about this period the anger of Pilate was
kindled against a Samaritan self-styled Messiah
or prophet, who called his believers together in a
village, promising to show them on Mount Gerizim
the holy vessels used in the time of Moses. The
Governor, who looked with suspicion upon every
gathering of the people, and regarded every exciting
incident as fraught with possible rebellion against
the Roman Empire, led his troops against the
Samaritans, and ordered the ringleaders, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
been caught in their flight, to be cruelly executed.
Judæans and Samaritans jointly denounced his
barbarity to Vitellius, the Governor of Syria, and
Pilate was summoned to Rome to justify himself.
The degree of favor shown to the Judæans by
Tiberius after the fall of Sejanus, explains the otherwise
surprising leniency evinced towards the Judæan
nation at that time. The Judæans had found an
advocate at court in Antonia, the sister-in-law of
Tiberius. The latter, who was the friend of a
patriotic prince of the house of Herod, had revealed
to Tiberius the plot framed against him by Sejanus,
and in grateful recognition Tiberius repealed the act
of outlawry against the Judæans. Vitellius, the
Governor of Syria, was graciously inclined towards
the Judæans, and not only inquired into their complaints,
but befriended them in every way, showing
a degree of indulgence and forbearance most
unusual in a Roman, in those subjects on which they
were peculiarly sensitive. When, on the occasion
of the Feast of Passover, Vitellius repaired to Jerusalem
in order to make himself acquainted with all
that was going on there, he sought to lighten as
much as possible the Roman yoke. He remitted
the tax on the fruits of the market, and as the capital
was mainly dependent upon that market for its
requirements, a heavy burden was thus removed
from the inhabitants of Jerusalem. He further withdrew
the pontifical robes from behind the lock and
bolts of the fort of Antonia, and gave them over to
the care of the College of Priests, who kept them for
some time. The right of appointing the High Priest
was considered too important to the interests of
Rome to be relinquished, and Vitellius himself made
use of it to install Jonathan, the son of Anan, in the
place of Joseph Caiaphas. Caiaphas had acted in concert
with Pilate during all the time he had governed,
and from his good understanding with the latter had
doubtless become distasteful to the Judæan nation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
The favor granted to the Judæans by Vitellius was
in accordance with the wishes of the Emperor, who
commanded him to aid the nation with all the available
Roman forces in an unjust cause&mdash;that of Herod
Antipas against King Aretas. Antipas, who was
married to the daughter of Aretas, king of the
Nabathæans, had nevertheless fallen in love with
Herodias, the wife of his half-brother Herod, who,
disinherited by his father Herod I., led a private life,
probably in Cæsarea. During a journey to Rome,
Antipas became acquainted with Herodias, who,
doubtless repining at her obscure position, abandoned
her husband, and after the birth of a daughter
contracted an illegal marriage with his brother.
Antipas' first wife, justly exasperated at his shameless
infidelity, had fled to her father Aretas, and
urged him to make war upon her faithless husband.
Antipas suffered a great defeat, which was no sooner
made known to the Emperor than he gave Vitellius
orders instantly to undertake his defense against the
king of the Nabathæans. As Vitellius was about to
conduct two legions from Ptolemais through Judæa,
the people took offense at the pictures of the
Emperor which the soldiers bore on their standards,
and which were to have been carried to Jerusalem,
but out of regard to the scruples of the Judæans,
Vitellius, instead of leading his army through Judæa,
conveyed it along the farther side of the Jordan.
Vitellius himself was received with the greatest
favor in Jerusalem, and offered sacrifices in the
Temple. Of all the Roman governors he was
the one who had shown most kindness to the
Judæans.</p>

<p class="center bpad">37&ndash;49 <span class="smcap smaller">C.&nbsp;E.</span></p>

<p>After the murder of the Roman Emperor Tiberius,
when the Senate indulged for the moment in the
sweet dream of regaining its liberty, Rome could
have had no forebodings that an enemy was born to
her in Jerusalem, in the half-fledged Christian community,
which would in time to come displace her
authority, trample upon her gods, shatter her power,
and bring about a gradual decadence, ending in
complete decay. An idea, conceived and brought
forth by one of Judæan birth and developed by a
despised class of society, was to tread the power
and glory of Rome in the dust. The third Roman
Emperor, Caius Caligula Germanicus, was himself
instrumental in delivering up to national contempt
the Roman deities, in a sense the corner-stone of
the Roman Empire. The throne of the Cæsars
had been alternately in the power of men actuated
by cruel cowardice and strange frenzy. None of the
nations tributary to Rome suffered more deeply
from this continual change in her masters than did
the Judæans. Every change in the great offices
of state affected Judæa, at times favorably, but more
often unfavorably. The first years of Caligula's
reign appeared to be auspicious for Judæa. Caligula<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
specially distinguished one of the Judæan princes,
Agrippa, with marks of his favor, thus holding out
the prospect of a milder rule. But it was soon evident
that this kindness, this good-will and favor,
were but momentary caprices, to be followed by
others of a far different and of a terrible character,
which threw the Judæans of the Roman Empire into
a state of fear and terror.</p>

<p>Agrippa (born 10 <span class="smcap smaller">B.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;E.</span>, died 44 <span class="smcap smaller">C.&nbsp;E.</span>) was the son
of the prince Aristobulus who had been assassinated
by Herod, and grandson of the Hasmonæan
princess Mariamne; thus in his veins ran the blood
of the Hasmonæans and Idumæans, and these two
hostile elements appeared to fight for the mastery
over his actions, until at last the nobler was victorious.
Educated in Rome, in the companionship of
Drusus, the son of Tiberius, the Herodian element
in Agrippa was the first to develop. As a Roman
courtier, intent upon purchasing Roman favor, he
dissipated his fortune and fell into debt. Forced
to quit Rome for Judæa, after the death of his friend
Drusus, he was reduced to such distress that he, who
was accustomed to live with the Cæsars, had to hide
in a remote part of Idumæa. It was then that he
contemplated suicide. But his high-spirited wife,
Cypros, who was resolved to save him from despair,
appealed to his sister Herodias, Princess of Galilee,
for instant help. And it was through the influence
of Antipas, the husband of this princess, that
Agrippa was appointed overseer of the markets
of Tiberias. Impatient of this dependent condition,
he suddenly resigned this office and became
courtier to Flaccus, governor of Syria. From this
very doubtful position he was driven by the jealousy
of his own brother Aristobulus. Seemingly abandoned
by all his friends, Agrippa determined
upon once more trying his fortune in Rome. The
richest and most distinguished Judæans of the Alexandrian
community, the Alabarch, Alexander Lysimachus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
with whom he had taken refuge, provided
him with the necessary means for his journey. This
noblest Judæan of his age, guardian of the property
of the young Antonia, the daughter of the triumvir,
had evidently rendered such services to the imperial
family that he had been adopted into it, and was
allowed to add their names to his own&mdash;Tiberius
Julius Alexander, son of Lysimachus. He possessed,
without doubt, the fine Greek culture of his age, for his
brother Philo was a man of the most exquisite taste in
Greek letters. But none the less did the Alabarch
Alexander cling warmly to his people and to his
Temple. Resolved to save Agrippa from ruin, but
distrustful of his extravagant character, he insisted
that his wife Cypros should become hostage for
him.</p>

<p>A new life of adventure now commenced in Rome
for Agrippa. He was met on the Isle of Capri by
the Emperor Tiberius, who, in remembrance of
Agrippa's close connection with the son he had lost,
received him most kindly. But upon hearing of the
enormous sum of money that Agrippa still owed to
the Roman treasury, Tiberius allowed him to fall
into disgrace. He was saved, however, by his
patroness Antonia, the sister-in-law of the emperor,
who maintained a friendly remembrance of Agrippa's
mother Berenice. By her mediation he was raised
to new honors, and became the trusted friend of the
heir to the throne, Caius Caligula. But, as though
Agrippa were destined to be the toy of every
caprice of fortune, he was soon torn from his intercourse
with the future emperor and thrown into
prison. In order to flatter Caligula, Agrippa once
expressed the wish, "Would that Tiberius would
soon expire and leave his throne to one worthier of
it." This was repeated by a slave to the emperor,
and Agrippa expiated his heedlessness by an imprisonment
of six months, from which the death of
Tiberius at last set him free (37).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
With the accession to the throne of his friend and
patron, Caligula, his star rose upon the horizon.
When the young emperor opened the prison-door
to Agrippa he presented him with a golden chain,
in exchange for the iron one that he had been forced
to wear on his account, and placed the royal diadem
upon his head, giving him the principality of Philip,
that had fallen to the Empire of Rome. By decree
of the Roman Senate he also received the title of
Prætor. So devoted was Caligula to Agrippa that,
during the first year of his reign, the Roman
emperor would not hear of his quitting Rome, and
when at length Agrippa was permitted to take possession
of his own kingdom, he had to give his solemn
promise that he would soon return to his
imperial friend.</p>

<p>When Agrippa made his entry into Judæa as monarch
and favorite of the Roman emperor, poor and
deeply in debt though he had been when he left it, his
wonderful change of fortune excited the envy of his
sister Herodias. Stung by ambition, she implored
of her husband also to repair to Rome and to obtain
from the generous young emperor at least another
kingdom. Once more the painful want of family
affection, common to all the Herodians, was brought
to light in all its baseness. Alarmed that Antipas
might succeed in winning Caligula's favor, or indignant
at the envious feelings betrayed by his sister,
Agrippa accused Antipas before the emperor
of treachery to the Roman Empire. The unfortunate
Antipas was instantly deprived of his principality
and banished to Lyons, whither he was
followed by his faithful and true-hearted wife.
Herod's last son, Herod Antipas, and his granddaughter,
Herodias, died in exile. Agrippa, by
imperial favor, became the heir of his brother-in-law,
and the provinces of Galilee and Peræa were added
to his other possessions.</p>

<p>The favor evinced by Caligula towards Agrippa,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
which might naturally be extended to the Judæan
people, awakened the envy of the heathens, and
brought the hatred of the Alexandrian Greeks to a
crisis. Indeed, the whole of the Roman Empire
harbored secret and public enemies of the Judæans.
Hatred of their race and of their creed was intensified
by a lurking fear that this despised yet proud
nation might one day attain to supreme power. But
the hostile feeling against the Judæans reached its
climax amongst the restless, sarcastic and pleasure-loving
Greek inhabitants of Alexandria. They
looked unfavorably upon the industry and prosperity
of their Judæan neighbors, by whom they were surpassed
in both these respects, and whom they did
not excel even in artistic and philosophical attainments.
These feelings of hatred dated from the
time when the Egyptian queen entrusted Judæan
generals with the management of the foreign affairs
of her country, and they increased in intensity when
the Roman emperors placed more confidence in the
reliable Judæans than in the frivolous Greeks.
Slanderous writers nourished this hatred, and in
their endeavors to throw contempt upon the Judæans
they falsified the history of which the Judæans were
justly proud.</p>

<p>The Stoic philosopher Posidonius circulated false
legends about the origin and the nature of the
divine worship of the Judæans, which legends had
been originally invented by the courtiers of Antiochus
Epiphanes. The disgraceful story of the
worship of an ass in the Temple of Jerusalem, besides
other tales as untrue and absurd, added to the
assertion that the Judæans hated all Gentiles, found
ready belief in a younger, contemporary writer,
Apollonius Malo, with whom Posidonius had become
acquainted in the island of Rhodes, and by
whom they were widely circulated. Malo gave a
new account of the history of the Judæan exodus,
which he declared was occasioned by some enormity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
on the part of the Judæans; he described Moses as
a criminal, and the Mosaic Law as containing the
most abominable precepts. He declared that the
Judæans were atheists, that they hated mankind in
general; he accused them of alternate acts of
cowardice and temerity, and maintained that they
were the most uncultured people amongst the barbarians,
and could not lay claim to the invention of
any one thing which had benefited humanity. It
was from these two Rhodian authors that the spiteful
and venom-tongued Cicero culled his unworthy
attack upon the Judæan race and the Judæan Law.
In this respect he differed from Julius Cæsar, who,
in spite of his associations with Posidonius and Malo,
was entirely free from all prejudice against the
Judæans.</p>

<p>The Alexandrian Greeks devoured these calumnies
with avidity, exaggerated them, and gave them
still wider circulation. Only three Greek authors
mentioned the Judæans favorably&mdash;Alexander Polyhistor,
Nicolaus of Damascus, the confidant of
Herod, and, lastly, Strabo, the most remarkable
geographer of ancient times, who devoted a fine
passage in his geographical and historical work
to Judaism. Although he mentions the Judæans
as having originated from Egypt, he does not
repeat the legend that their expulsion was occasioned
by some fault of their own. Far otherwise
he explains the Exodus, affirming that the Egyptian
mode of life, with its unworthy idolatry, had driven
Moses and his followers from the shores of the Nile.
He writes in praise of the Mosaic teaching relative
to the unity of God, as opposed to the Egyptian
plurality of deities, and of the spiritual, imageless
worship of the Judæans in contrast to the animal
worship of the Egyptians, and to the investing of
the divinity with a human form among the Greeks.
"How can any sensible man," he exclaims, "dare
make an image of the Heavenly King?" Widely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
opposed to the calumniators of Judaism, Strabo
teaches that the Mosaic Law was the great mainstay
of righteousness, for it holds out the divine blessing
to all those whose lives are pure. For some time
after the death of their great lawgiver, Strabo maintains
that the Judæans acted in conformity with the
Law, doing right and fearing God. Of the sanctuary
in Jerusalem he speaks with veneration, for, although
the Judæan kings were often faithless to the Law of
Moses and to their subjects, yet the capital of the
Judæans was invested with its own dignity, and the
people, far from looking upon it as the seat of
despotism, revered and honored it as the Temple of
God.</p>

<p>One author exceeded all the other hostile writers
in the outrageous nature of his calumnies; this was
the Egyptian Apion, who was filled with burning
envy at the prosperous condition of the Judæans.
He gave a new and exaggerated account of all the
old stories of his predecessors, and gained the ear
of the credulous multitude by the readiness and
fluency of his pen. Apion was one of those
charlatans whose conduct is based on the assumption
that the world wishes to be deceived,
and therefore it shall be deceived. As expounder
of the Homeric songs, he traveled through Greece
and Asia Minor, and invented legends so flattering
to the early Greeks that he became the hero of their
descendants. He declared that he had witnessed
most things of which he wrote, or that he had been
instructed in them by the most reliable people; and
even affirmed that Homer's shade had appeared to
him, and had divulged which Grecian town had given
birth to the oldest of Greek bards, but that he dared
not publish that secret. On account of his intense
vanity he was called the trumpet of his own fame,
for he assured the Alexandrians that they were fortunate
in being able to claim him as a citizen. It is
not astonishing that so unscrupulous a man should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
have made use of the hatred they bore to the
Judæans to do the latter all the injury in his power.</p>

<p>But the hostility of the Alexandrians, based on
envy and religious and racial antipathy, was suppressed
under the reign of Augustus and Tiberius,
when the imperial governors of Egypt sternly reprimanded
all those who might have become disturbers
of the peace. Affairs changed, however, when Caligula
came to the throne, for the Alexandrians were
then aware that the governor Flaccus, who had been
a friend of Tiberius, was unfavorably looked upon by
his successor, who was ready to lend a willing ear
to any accusation against him. Flaccus, afraid of
drawing the attention of the revengeful emperor
upon himself, was cowed into submission by the
Alexandrians, and became a mere tool in their
hands. At the news of Agrippa's accession to the
throne, they were filled with burning envy, and the
delight of the Alexandrian Judæans, with whom
Agrippa came into contact through the Alabarch
Alexander, only incensed them still more and
roused them to action.</p>

<p>Two most abject beings were the originators and
leaders of this anti-Judæan demonstration; a venal
clerk of the court of justice, Isidorus, who was called
by the popular wits, the Pen of Blood, because his
pettifoggery had robbed many of their life, and
Lampo, one of those unprincipled profligates that
are brought forth by a burning climate and an immoral
city. These two agitators ruled, on the one
hand, the weak and helpless governor, and, on the
other, they led the dregs of the people, who were
prepared to give vent to their feelings of hatred towards
the Judæans upon a sign from their leaders.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Agrippa, whose change of fortune
had been an offense in the eyes of the Alexandrians,
touched at their capital upon his return from Rome
to Judæa (July, 38), and his presence roused the
enemies of the Judæans to fresh conspiracies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
These began with a farce, but ended for the Judæans
in terrible earnest. At first Agrippa and his race
were insultingly jeered at. A harmless fool, Carabas,
was tricked out in a crown of papyrus and a
cloak of plaited rushes; a whip was given him for
a scepter, and he was placed on an eminence for a
throne, where he was saluted by all passers-by as
Marin (which, in the Chaldaic tongue, denotes "our
master"). This was followed by the excitable mob's
rushing at the dawn of the next day into the synagogues,
carrying with them busts of the emperor,
with the pretext of dedicating these places of worship
to Caligula. In addition to this, at the importunate
instance of the conspirators, the governor,
Flaccus, was induced to withdraw from the Judæan
inhabitants of Alexandria what they had held so
gratefully from the first emperors&mdash;the right of
citizenship. This was a terrible blow to the Judæans
of Alexandria, proud as they were of their
privileges, and justly entitled to the credit of
having enriched this metropolis by their learning,
their wealth, their love of art and their spirit of
commerce equally with the Greeks. They were
cruelly driven out of the principal parts of the city
of Alexandria, and were forced to congregate in
the Delta, or harbor of the town. The mob, greedy
for spoil, dashed into the deserted houses and work-shops,
and plundered, destroyed and annihilated
what had been gathered together by the industry
of centuries.</p>

<p>After committing these acts of depredation, the
infuriated Alexandrians surrounded the Delta, under
the idea that the unfortunate Judæans would be
driven to open resistance by the pangs of hunger
or by the suffocating heat they were enduring in
their close confinement. When at last the scarcity
of provisions impelled some of the besieged to
venture out of their miserable quarters, they were
cruelly ill-treated by the enemy, tortured, and either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
burnt alive or crucified. This state of things lasted
for a month. The governor went so far as to
arrest thirty-eight members of the Great Council,
to throw them into prison and publicly to scourge
them. Even the female sex was not spared. If
any maidens or women crossed the enemy's path
they were offered pig's flesh as food, and upon their
refusing to eat it they were cruelly tortured. Not
satisfied with all these barbarities, Flaccus ordered
his soldiers to search the houses of the Judæans for
any weapons that might be concealed there, and
they were told to leave not even the chambers of
modest maidens unsearched. This reign of terror
continued until the middle of September. At that
time an imperial envoy appeared to depose Flaccus
and to summon him to Rome, not on account of
his abominable conduct towards the Judæans, but
because he was hated by the emperor. His sentence
was exile and he was eventually killed.</p>

<p>The emperor alone could have settled the vexed
question as to whether the Judæans had the right
of equal citizenship with the Greeks in Alexandria;
but he was then in Germany or in Gaul celebrating
childish triumphs, or in Britain gathering shells on
the seashore. When he returned to Rome (August,
40) with the absurd idea of allowing himself to be
worshiped as a god, and of raising temples and
statues to his own honor, the heathen Greeks justly
imagined that their cause against the Judæans was
won. They restored the imperial statues in the
Alexandrian synagogues, convinced that in the face
of so great a sacrilege the Judæans would rebel and
thereby arouse the emperor's wrath. This was
actually the cause of a fresh disturbance, for the
new governor of Alexandria took part against the
Judæans, courting in this way the imperial favor.
He insisted that the unhappy people should show
divine honors to the images of the emperor, and
when they refused on the ground that such an act<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
was contrary to their Law, he forbade their observance
of the Sabbath day. In the following words
he addressed the most distinguished of their race:
"How would it be if you were suddenly overwhelmed
by a host of enemies, or by a tremendous
inundation, or by a raging fire; if famine, pestilence
or an earthquake were to overtake you upon the
Sabbath day? Would you sit idly in your synagogues,
reading the Law and expounding difficult
passages? Would you not rather think of the
safety of parents and children, of your property
and possessions, would you not fight for your lives?
Now behold, if you do not obey my commands, I
will be all that to you, the invasion of the enemy,
the terrible inundation, the raging fire, famine, pestilence,
earthquake, the visible embodiment of
relentless fate." But neither the rich nor the poor
allowed themselves to be coerced by these words;
they remained true to their faith, and prepared to
undergo any penalties that might be inflicted upon
them. Some few appear to have embraced paganism
out of fear or from worldly motives. The
Judæan philosopher, Philo, gives some account of
the renegades of his time and his community, whom
he designates as frivolous, immoral, and utterly
unworthy. Amongst them may be mentioned the
son of the Alabarch Alexander, Tiberius Julius
Alexander, who forsook Judaism, and was consequently
raised to high honors in the Roman State.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Judæans determined upon pleading
their cause before the emperor. Three men
(who were specially adapted for their mission) were
selected to be sent as envoys to Rome. One of
these, the Judæan philosopher, Philo, was so far
distinguished through birth, social standing, profound
culture, and brilliant eloquence, that no better
pleader for the cause of justice could have been
found. Through the medium of his powerful writings
Philo has so largely influenced not only his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
contemporaries but also those who came after him,
both within and without the Judæan community,
that the scanty accounts of his life must not be
passed over. As brother of the Alabarch Alexander,
Philo belonged to the most distinguished
and wealthy family of the Alexandrian community.
He received in his youth the usual education
which all well-born parents held as necessary for
their sons. Possessed of unquenchable love for
learning, he obtained complete mastery over his
studies. His taste for metaphysical research was
developed at a very early age, and he devoted himself
to it untiringly for a time, taking delight in that
alone. He affirms enthusiastically that he had no
desire for honors, wealth, or material pleasures, so
long as he could revel in ethereal realms, in company
with the heavenly bodies. He belonged to the few
elect who do not creep on the earth's surface, but
who free themselves from all earthly bondage in
the sublime flight of thought. He rejoiced in being
exempt from cares and occupations. But though
he gloried in philosophy, Judaism, which he
termed the "true wisdom," was still dearer to his
heart. When he gathered the beautiful blossoms
of Grecian learning, it was to twine them into a
garland with which to adorn Judaism. Philo had
been leading the retired life of a student for some
time, when, as he bitterly remarked, an event drew
him unmercifully into the whirlpool of political
troubles: the miserable condition of his people
had probably disturbed his contemplative life. In
later years he looked back with longing upon his
former occupation, and lamented that practical
life had obscured his vision for intellectual things,
and had materially interfered with his range of
thought; but he consoled himself with the knowledge
that in undisturbed hours he was still able to
lift his mind to noble objects. Philo's philosophical
researches not only furnished food for his intellect,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
but helped to inspire him with true nobility of
character, developing in him a nature that regarded
all acts of human folly, vulgarity, and vice as so
many enigmas which he could not solve.</p>

<p>His wife, who was justly proud of him, emulated
him in the simplicity of her life. When asked by
some of her brilliantly attired friends why she, who
was so rich, should disdain to wear gold ornaments,
she is said to have answered, "The virtue of the
husband is adornment enough for the wife." Philo's
contemporaries were never weary of praising his
style; so forcibly indeed did it remind them of
Plato's beautiful diction that they would observe,
"Plato writes like Philo, or Philo like Plato."
Philo's principal aim was to harmonize the spirit
of Judaism with that of the philosophy of the age,
or, more rightly speaking, to show that Judaism is
the truest philosophy. And this was not merely
to be an intellectual exercise, but to him it was a
sacred mission. He was so completely absorbed in
these ideas that, as he relates of himself, he often
fell into trances, when he fancied that revelations
were vouchsafed to him which he could not have
grasped at ordinary times.</p>

<p>This was the man who was to present himself
before the emperor, as the representative of the
Alexandrian Judæan community. The heathen
Alexandrians also sent a deputation, headed by
Apion, to which also belonged the venom-tongued
Isidorus. Not only were the envoys concerned
with the privileges of the community they represented,
but they were pledged to raise their voices
against the cruel persecution of their race. For
the first time in history were Judaism and Paganism
confronted in the lists, each of them being represented
by men of Greek culture and learning. Had
the two forms of faith and civilization been judged by
their exponents, the decision for Judaism would not
have been doubtful. Philo, dignified and earnest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
seemed in himself to embody faithful search after
truth, and the purest moral idealism; whilst Apion,
frivolous and sarcastic, was the very incarnation
of smooth-tongued vainglory, and bore the stamp
of the vanity and self-conceit of fallen Greece.
But the outcome of this contest remains doubtful.
Caligula was too passionate a partisan to
be a just umpire. He hated the Judæans because
they would not recognize and worship him as their
deity, and his hatred was fanned by two contemptible
creatures, whom he had dragged from the
mire and had attached to himself&mdash;the Egyptian
Helicon and Apelles of Ascalon.</p>

<p>The Judæan envoys were hardly permitted to
speak when they were admitted to the imperial
presence, and Caligula's first word was one of
jarring reproof: "So you are the despisers of God,
who will not recognize me as the deity, but who
prefer worshiping a nameless one, whilst all my
other subjects have accepted me as their god."
The Judæan envoys declared that they had offered
up three successive offerings in honor of Caligula:
the first upon his accession to the throne; the
second upon his recovery from a severe illness;
and the third after his so-called victory over the
Teutons. "That may be," answered Caligula, "but
the offerings were made <i>for me</i> and <i>not to me</i>; for
such I do not care. And how is it," he continued,
awakening the ribald merriment of his pagan audience,
"how is it that you do not eat pig's flesh, and
upon what grounds do you hold your right of
equality with the Alexandrians?" Without waiting
for a reply, he turned his attention to something
else. Later on when he dismissed the Judæan
envoys, he remarked that they seemed less wicked
than stupid in not being willing to acknowledge his
divinity.</p>

<p>Whilst the unfortunate ambassadors were vainly
seeking to gain ground with the emperor, they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
suddenly overwhelmed with tidings that struck terror
into their hearts. One of their own race burst into
their presence, exclaiming, amidst uncontrollable
sobs, that the Temple in the holy city had been
profaned by Caligula. For not only were the imperial
statues to be erected in the synagogues, but
also in the Temple of Jerusalem. The governor
of Syria, Petronius, had received orders to enter
Judæa with his legions and to turn the Sanctuary
into a pagan temple. It is easy to conceive the
mortal anguish of the Judæan nation when these
orders became known to them. On the eve of the
Feast of Tabernacles a messenger appeared in
Jerusalem, who converted this feast of rejoicing
into mourning. Petronius and his legions were
at Accho, on the outskirts of Jerusalem, but, as
the rainy season was at hand, and as obstinate
resistance was expected, the Roman commander
resolved to await the spring before commencing
active operations. Thousands of Judæans hastened
to appear before Petronius, declaring that they
would rather suffer the penalty of death than allow
their Temple to be desecrated. Petronius, perplexed
as to how he should carry out this mad
scheme of Caligula's, consulted the members of the
Royal Council, entreating of them to influence the
people in his favor. But the Judæan aristocracy,
and even Agrippa's own brother Aristobulus, held
with the people. Petronius then sent a true statement
of the case to the emperor, hoping that he
might be induced to abandon his scheme. Meanwhile
he pacified the people by telling them that
nothing could be effected until fresh edicts arrived
from Rome, and begged of them to return to their
agricultural duties, and thus to avert the possibility
of a year of famine.</p>

<p>But before Petronius' letter was in the hands of
the emperor, Caligula's intentions had been frustrated
by Agrippa. The Judæan king had acquired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
so extraordinary an influence over Caligula that the
Romans called him and Antiochus of Commagene,
his teachers in tyranny. Agrippa, who was living
at that time near the person of the emperor, could
not have been indifferent to the desecration of the
Temple, but he was too accomplished a courtier
openly to oppose this imperial caprice. On the
contrary, he seemed dead to the cry of anguish
that arose from his people, and only occupied in
preparing, with the most lavish expenditure, a magnificent
feast for the emperor and his favorites.
But under this garb of indifference he was really
working for his people's cause. Caligula, flattered
by the attentions that were lavished upon him, bade
Agrippa demand a boon, which should be instantly
granted. His astonishment was indeed boundless
when the Judæan monarch begged for the repeal
of the imperial edict concerning images. He
had little thought that his refined courtier would
prove so unselfish a man, so pious, and so thoroughly
independent of the will of the emperor.
Cunning as he was, Caligula was helplessly entrapped,
for he could not retract his pledged
word. Thus he was forced to write to Petronius
annulling his former decree. Meanwhile he received
Petronius' letter, in which the governor detailed
what difficulties he would encounter, were he to
attempt to execute the orders of his master. More
than this was not required to lash Caligula's passionate
and excitable nature into a fury. A new
and stringent order was given to proceed with the
introduction of the statues into the Temple of Jerusalem.
But before this order, terrible to the
Judæans and full of danger to Petronius himself,
had arrived in Jerusalem, it was announced that
the insane Caligula had met with his death at the
hands of the Prætorian Tribune Chereas (24 Jan.,
41). These tidings came to Jerusalem on the 22d
of Shebat (March, 41), and the day was afterwards
celebrated as one of great rejoicing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
Caligula's successor upon the throne of the
Cæsars was Claudius, a learned pedant and a fool.
He owed his crown to chance, and to the diplomacy
of King Agrippa, who had induced the reluctant
Senate to accept the choice of the Prætorians.
Rome must indeed have fallen low when
a somewhat insignificant Judæan prince was allowed
to speak in the Senate House, and, in some
measure, to have influence in the choice of her
ruler. Claudius was not ungrateful to his ally; he
lauded him before the assembled Senate, raised him
to the dignity of consul, and made him king of all
Palestine, for Judæa and Samaria were incorporated
with the monarchy.</p>

<p>As a remembrance of these events, the emperor
ordered an inscription to be engraved on tablets of
bronze, in pedantic imitation of the classical age,
and coins to be struck, bearing on one side two
clasped hands, with these words, "Friendship and
comradeship of King Agrippa with the Senate and
the Roman people." On the other side was the
emperor between two figures, and the inscription:
"King Agrippa, friend of the emperor." The kingdom
of Judæa had thus recovered its full extent;
indeed, it had acquired even a greater area than it
possessed formerly under the Hasmonæans and
Herod I.</p>

<p>Herod II., brother and son-in-law of King Agrippa,
received from Claudius the rank of Prætor, and was
made prince of Chalcis, in Lebanon. The Alexandrian
Judæans greatly benefited by the new order
of things which was brought about in the vast
Roman Empire by the death of Caligula. The
emperor Claudius freed the Alabarch Alexander,
with whom he was on friendly terms, from the
imprisonment into which his predecessor had thrown
him, and settled the disputes of the Alexandrians
in favor of the Judæans. Caligula's prejudice
against that unfortunate community had developed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
their independence, and their strength was far from
being broken. Their rights and privileges were
fully re-established by an edict of the new emperor,
and they were placed on an equal footing with
the Greek inhabitants of Egypt. The dignity of
the Alabarch was restored by the emperor, and
this was most important to the Judæans, for it
assured them of the leadership of one of their own
race, and made them independent of the Roman
officials. It was during this reign that Philo gave
the wealth of his learning to a wide circle of readers,
and was instrumental in bringing Judæan-Greek
culture to its zenith. Claudius extended his goodwill
to the Judæans of the entire Roman Empire,
granting them complete religious freedom, and protecting
them from the interference of the pagans.</p>

<p>When Agrippa, laden with honors, left Rome
for Judæa to take possession of his kingdom,
his subjects remarked that some great change
was manifest in him, and that the stirring revolution
in Rome, by which a headstrong emperor
had been dethroned in favor of a weak one, had
deeply impressed their own monarch. The frivolous
Agrippa returned an earnest-minded man;
the courtier had given place to the patriot; the
pleasure-loving prince to the conscientious monarch,
who was fully aware of what he owed his
nation. The Herodian nature had, in fact, been
entirely subdued by the Hasmonæan. For the last
time, Judæa enjoyed under his reign a short span of
undisturbed happiness; and his subjects, won by his
generous affection, which even risked forfeiting the
good will of Rome in their cause, repaid him with
untiring devotion, the bitterest enemies of his
scepter becoming his ardent supporters. Historians
do not weary of praising Agrippa's loving adherence
to Judaism; it seemed as if he were endeavoring
to rebuild what had been cast down by Herod.
He mixed freely with the people when they carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
the first fruits into the Temple, and bore his own
offering of fruit or grain to the Sanctuary. He
re-established the old law that obliged the king to
read the book of Deuteronomy in the Court of the
Temple at the close of each year of release. Facing
the congregation, Agrippa performed this act for the
first time in the autumn of the year 42, and when
he came to the verse, "From amongst your brethren
shall you choose a king," he burst into a passion
of tears, for he was painfully aware of his Idumæan
descent, and knew that he was unworthy of being
a king of Judæa. But the assembled multitude,
and even the Pharisees, exclaimed with enthusiasm:
"Thou art our brother; thou art our brother!"</p>

<p>Agrippa's careful government made itself felt
throughout the entire community. Without doubt
the Synhedrion, under the presidency of Gamaliel I.
(ha-Zaken, the elder), the worthy grandson of
Hillel, was permitted to take the management of
home affairs into its own hands. The presidency
acquired greater importance under Gamaliel than
it had enjoyed before; for the Synhedrion, modeled
upon the political constitution of the country, partook
somewhat of a monarchical character. The
consent of the president was required for the interpolation
of a leap year, and all letters or mandates
addressed to near or distant communities were
sent in his name. The formulæ of these letters,
which have in some instances been handed down
to us, are extremely interesting, both in contents
and form, for they prove that all Judæan communities,
as well as their representatives, acknowledged
the supreme authority of the Synhedrion.
Gamaliel would address a foreign community through
the pen of his accomplished secretary, Jochanan, in
these terms: "To our brethren in Upper and Lower
Galilee, greeting: We make known to you that the
time has arrived for the ingathering of the tithes of
your olive yards." "To our brethren, the exiles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
in Babylon, Media, Greece (Ionia), and to all other
exiles, greeting: We make known to you that as in
this season the lambs are still very small, and the
doves have not yet their full-grown wings, the
spring being very backward this season, it pleases
me and my colleagues to prolong the year by thirty
days."</p>

<p>Many excellent laws emanated from Gamaliel;
they were principally directed against the abuses
that had crept in, or were aimed at promoting
the welfare of the whole community. It was the
true spirit of Hillel that pervaded the laws framed
by Gamaliel for the intercourse between the Judæans
and the heathens. The heathen poor were permitted
to glean the fields in the wake of the reapers, and
were treated exactly like the Judæan poor, and the
pagans were given the peace greetings upon their
own festivals when they were following their own
rites. The poor in all towns of mixed population
received equal treatment; they were helped in time
of distress, their sick were nursed, their dead were
honorably treated, their sorrowing ones were comforted,
whether they were pagans or Judæans. In
these ordinances, so full of kindly feeling towards
the heathen, the influence of Agrippa is plainly
visible. Rome and Judæa had for the moment laid
aside their mutual antipathy, and their intercourse
was characterized by love and forbearance. The
generosity of the emperor towards the Judæans
went so far that he severely punished some thoughtless
Greek youths in the town of Dora for attempting
to introduce his statues into the synagogues. The
governor Petronius was ordered to be strict in the
prevention of such desecration.</p>

<p>Agrippa had inherited from his grandfather
Herod the wish to be popular among the Greeks.
As Herod had sent presents to Athens and other
Greek and Ionian towns, so his grandson conferred
a great benefit upon the degenerate city, once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
mother of the arts, a benefit which her citizens did
not easily forget. He also showered favors upon
the inhabitants of Cæsarea, the city that Herod had
raised as a rival of Jerusalem, and upon the Greeks
of the seaboard Sebaste, who lived in their own
special quarter. These recipients of his benefits
exerted themselves to give proofs of their gratitude.
The people of Sebaste raised statues to his three
daughters, and struck coins in his honor, bearing
the inscription&mdash;"To the great king Agrippa, friend
of the emperor." The last years of this monarch's
reign were happy for his nation, both within and
without the kingdom of Judæa. They were like the
rosy flush in the evening sky that precedes, not the
dawn of day, but the blackness of night. In some
respects they call to mind the reign of King Josiah
in the earlier history of the nation, when the kingdom
enjoyed tranquillity at home and independence
abroad, with no dearth of intellectual activity.</p>

<p>Philo visited Jerusalem during Agrippa's reign,
and was able to take part in the people's joy at
the revocation of Caligula's edicts. Never before
had the first fruits been carried into the Temple
with greater solemnity or with more heartfelt
rejoicing. To the bright strains of musical instruments
the people streamed into the Sanctuary with
their offerings, where they were received by the
most distinguished of their race. A psalm was
then chanted, which described how the worshipers
had passed from sorrow into gladness.</p>

<p>It was at this time that a great queen, followed
by her numerous retinue, arrived in Jerusalem, she
having renounced paganism for Judaism, thus filling
to the brim the cup of gladness of the once persecuted
but now honored race.</p>

<p>The happy era of Agrippa's reign was, however,
not to be of long duration. Although he had
gained the complete confidence of the emperor,
the Roman dignitaries looked upon him with suspicion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
and beheld in each step made by the Judæan
king some traces of disaffection; and they were not
far wrong. For, however much Agrippa might
coquet with Rome, he was yet determined to make
Judæa capable of resisting that great power, should
an encounter, which he deemed inevitable, occur
between the two. His people should not be
dependent upon the caprice of one individual.
Thus he resolved to strengthen Jerusalem. He
chose for this purpose the suburb of Bezetha, to
the northeast of the city, and there he ordered
powerful fortifications to be built. They were to
constitute a defense for the fortress of Antonia,
which lay between Bezetha and Jerusalem. He
applied to Rome for the necessary permission,
which was readily granted by Claudius, who could
deny him nothing, and the Roman favorites who
would have opposed him were silenced by gifts.
The fortifications were commenced, but their completion
was interrupted by the governor of Syria,
Vibius Marsus. He saw through Agrippa's scheme,
plainly told the emperor of the dangers that would
surely menace Rome if Jerusalem could safely set
her at defiance, and succeeded in wringing from
Claudius the revocation of his permission. Agrippa
was forced to obey, not being in the position to
openly offer resistance. But at heart he determined
upon weakening the Roman sway in Judæa. To
attain these ends, he allied himself secretly with
those princes with whom he was connected by
marriage or on terms of friendly relationship, and
invited them to a conference at Tiberias, under the
pretext of meeting for general amusement and
relaxation. There came at his call to the Galilean
capital Antiochus, king of Commagene, whose son
Epiphanes was affianced to Agrippa's youngest
daughter; Samsigeranus, king of Emesa, whose
daughter Jatape was married to Agrippa's brother
Aristobulus; then Cotys, king of Armenia Minor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
Polemon, prince of Cilicia, and lastly, Herod,
Agrippa's brother, prince of Chalcis. All these
princes owed their positions to Agrippa, and were
therefore liable to lose them at the accession of
the next emperor or at the instigation of some
influential person at the court of Claudius. But
Marsus, suspicious of this understanding between
so many rulers, and distrustful of the cause that
brought them together, suddenly presented himself
in their midst, and, with the ancient Roman bluntness,
bade them return each man to his own city.
So tremendous was the power of Rome, that at one
word from an underling of the emperor the meeting
was annulled. But the energy and perseverance
of Agrippa would probably have spared Judæa from
any possible humiliation, and assured her future
safety, had his life been prolonged; he met, however,
with an unexpected death at the age of
fifty-four. Judæa's star sank with that monarch,
who died, like Josiah, the last great king of the pre-exilian
age, a quarter of a century before the destruction
of his State.</p>

<p>It soon became evident that the Greek inhabitants
of Palestine had but dissembled their true
feelings in regard to King Agrippa. Forgetful of
that monarch's benefits, the Syrians and Greeks of
the city of Cæsarea, and of the seaboard of Sebaste,
solaced themselves by heaping abuse upon his
memory, and by offering up thank-offerings to
Charon for his death. The Roman soldiery quartered
in those towns made common cause with the
Greeks, and carried the statues of Agrippa's daughters
into brothels.</p>

<p>Claudius was not indifferent to the insults offered
to his dead friend's memory. He was, on the contrary,
anxious to raise Agrippa's son, Agrippa II.,
to the throne of Judæa. But in this he was opposed
by his two all-powerful favorites, Pallas and Narcissus,
on the plea of the prince's youth (he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
seventeen years of age), and Judæa was thus allowed
to sink once more into a Roman province.</p>

<p>However, out of affection and respect to the dead
king, the emperor gave the Judæan governor Cuspius
Fadus a somewhat independent position in
regard to the Syrian governor Vibius Marsus, who
had always been hostile to Agrippa and the Judæans.
It was his soldiery who had insulted the
memory of the Judæan monarch, and for this
cowardly action they were to be punished and
exiled to Pontus. They managed, however, to
extort a pardon from the emperor, and remained
in Judæa, a circumstance which contributed not a
little to excite the bitterest feelings of the national
party, which they fully returned. They could ill
control their hatred of the Judæans, stinging the
latter into retaliation. Companies of freebooters
under daring leaders prepared, as after the death
of Herod, to free their country from the yoke of
Rome. But Fadus was prepared for this rising.
It was his desire to strengthen the Roman rule in
Judæa, and to give it the same importance that it
had had before the reign of Agrippa; and to this
end he attempted to keep the selection of the high
priest and the sacred robes in his own hands. But
in this he met resistance both in the person of the
high priest and at the hands of Agrippa's brother,
Herod II.</p>

<p>Jerusalem was so greatly excited by these proceedings
that not only did the governor Fadus
appear within the city, but he was accompanied by
Caius Cassius Longinus at the head of his troops.
Herod and his brother Aristobulus begged for a
truce of hostilities, as they were anxious to send
envoys to Rome. This they were allowed to do,
only on the condition that they surrendered themselves
as hostages for the preservation of peace.
Having willingly complied, an embassy, consisting
of four men&mdash;Cornelius, Tryphon, Dorotheus, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
John&mdash;started for Rome. When they arrived in
that city they were introduced to the emperor by
the young Agrippa. Claudius, still faithful to his
old affection for the Herodians, granted the Judæans
full right to follow their own laws, and
gave Herod permission to choose the high priest
of the Sanctuary. Taking instant advantage of this
permission, Herod raised Joseph, of the house of
Camith, to the high priesthood in the place of
Elionai, his brother's choice. To a certain extent
Herod II. may be regarded as king of Judæa, but
he exerted no influence upon the course of political
events. All legal power was vested in the hands
of the governor; the Synhedrion lost, under the
sway of his successor, the power which it had regained
under Agrippa.</p>

<p>Fadus was confronted with a rising of another
nature during his governorship. A certain Theudas
appeared as prophet or messiah, and was followed
by four hundred disciples, for the messianic redemption
was quickly growing into a necessity for the
nation. To give proof of his power he declared
that he would divide the waters of the Jordan, and
would lead his followers safe across the bed of the
river. But when his band of disciples approached
the riverside, carrying with them much of their
worldly possessions, they were confronted by a
troop of Fadus's cavalry soldiers, who slew some,
made others prisoners, and decapitated their leader.</p>

<p>Shortly after these events Fadus was recalled
from Jerusalem, and his place was taken by Tiberius
Julius Alexander, son of the Alabarch Alexander,
nephew of the Judæan philosopher Philo. Tiberius,
who had espoused paganism, bore already the
dignity of a Roman knight. The Emperor believed
doubtless that in naming a Judæan of a distinguished
house as governor over the land, he was giving
proof of his friendliness to the nation. He did not
imagine that their sensitive natures would be violently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
opposed to the fact of being governed by a
renegade. The people seem indeed to have been
most uncomfortable under the rule of Tiberius; the
zealots lifted up their heads and excited an insurrection.
They were led by Jacob and Simon and
the sons of the zealot Judah, but no details of this
revolt are extant. To judge by the severity of the
sentence passed upon the ringleaders by the governor,
it must have been of a grave character, for
the two brothers suffered crucifixion, the most degrading
form of capital punishment amongst the
Romans. Tiberius Alexander remained only two
years at his post. He was afterwards named governor
of Egypt, and exercised considerable influence
in the choice of the emperor.</p>

<p>Herod II., king of Chalcis, titular king of Judæa,
died at this time (48), and with him the third generation
of Herodians sank into the grave.</p>

<p class="center bpad">40&ndash;49 <span class="smcap smaller">C.&nbsp;E.</span></p>

<p>Round the very cradle of the Judæan race there had
rung prophetic strains, telling of endless wanderings
and dispersions. No other people had ever heard
such alarming predictions, and they were being fulfilled
in all their literal horror. There was hardly
a corner in the two great predominant kingdoms of
that time, the Roman and the Parthian, in which
Judæans were not living, and where they had not
formed themselves into a religious community. The
shores of the great midland sea, and the outlets of
all the principal rivers of the old world, of the Nile,
the Euphrates, the Tigris, and the Danube, were
peopled with Judæans. A cruel destiny seemed to
be ever thrusting them away from their central home.
Yet this dispersion was the work of Providence and
was to prove a blessing. The continuance of the
Judæan race was thus assured. Down-trodden and
persecuted in one country, they fled to another,
where the old faith, which became ever dearer to
them, found a new home. Seeds were scattered
here and there, destined to carry far and wide the
knowledge of God and the teachings of pure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
morality. Just as the Greek colonies kindled in
various nations the love of art and culture, and
the Roman settlements gave rise in many lands
to communities governed by law, so had the far
wider dispersion of the oldest civilized people contributed
to overthrow the errors and combat the
sensual vices of the heathen world. In spite of being
thus scattered, the members of the Judæan people
were not completely divided from one another;
they had a common center of union in the Temple
of Jerusalem and in the Synhedrion which met in
the hall of hewn stone, and to these the dispersed
communities clung with loving hearts. Towards
them their looks were ever fondly directed, and by
sending their gifts to the Temple they continued to
participate, at least by their contributions, in the
sacrificial worship. From the Synhedrion they received
their code of laws, which they followed the
more willingly as it was not forced upon them. The
Synhedrion, from time to time, sent deputations to
the different communities, both far and near, to
acquaint them with the most important decisions.</p>

<p>The visits paid to the Temple by the Judæans
who lived out of Palestine, strengthened the bond of
unity, and these visits must have been of frequent
occurrence, for they necessitated the creation of
many places of worship in Jerusalem where the various
foreign Judæans met for prayer. The capital
contained synagogues of the Alexandrians, Cyrenians,
Libertines, Elymæans, and Asiatics. One can
form some idea of the vast numbers of Judæans existing
at that period if one considers that Egypt alone,
from the Mediterranean to the Ethiopian boundary,
contained nearly a million. In the neighboring
country of Cyrenaica, there were likewise many
Judæans, some having been forcibly transplanted
thither from Egypt, whilst others were voluntary
emigrants. In many parts of Syria, and especially
in its capital, Antioch, the Judæans formed a considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
portion of the population. The kings of
Syria who succeeded Antiochus Epiphanes had
reinstated them in all their rights, of which the half-insane
Epiphanes had robbed them. One of these
kings had even given them some of the utensils
taken from the Temple, and these were preserved
in their synagogue. About ten thousand Judæans
lived at Damascus, and one of their nobles was
made ethnarch over them by the Nabathæan king,
Aretas Philodemus, just as in Alexandria one of
their most distinguished members was elected chief
of the community. To the great capital of the
world, Rome, the point of attraction for the ambitious
and the grasping, the discontented and the
visionaries, the Judæans returned in such masses
after their expulsion by Tiberius, that when the
Emperor Claudius determined, from some unknown
cause, upon expelling them again, he was
only deterred, by fear of their great numbers,
from endeavoring to carry out his intention. Meanwhile
he forbade their religious meetings. Towards
the end of his reign, however, on account of some
disturbances occasioned by a certain Christian
apostle, Chrestus, they were probably, but only in
part, banished from Rome.</p>

<p>Even greater than in Europe, Syria and Africa
was the number of Judæans in the Parthian Empire.
They were the descendants of former exiles, who
owned large tracts of country in Mesopotamia and
Babylonia. Two youths from Naarda (Nahardea
on the Euphrates) called Asinaï (Chasinaï) and
Anilaï (Chanilaï) founded in the vicinity of that town
a robber settlement, which spread terror along the
bordering countries. Just as Naarda and Nisibis
became the central points for the countries of the
Euphrates, there arose in every land a central
nucleus from which Judæan colonies spread themselves
out into neighboring lands, from Asia Minor
on the one side, towards the Black Sea on the other,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
towards Greece and the Islands. Athens, Corinth,
Thessalonica, and Philippi contained Judæan communities.
There is no doubt that from Rome
Judæan colonies went forth westward to the south
of France and Spain.</p>

<p>The effect produced by the Judæans upon the
heathens was at first repellent. Their peculiar
mode of living, their dress and their religious views,
caused them to be considered as strange, enigmatical,
mysterious beings, who at one moment inspired
awe, and at another derision and contempt. So
thorough was the opposition between the Judæans
and the heathens that it manifested itself in all their
actions. Everything that was holy in the eyes of
the heathens was looked upon with horror by the
Judæans, whilst objects of indifference to the former
were considered sacred by the latter. The withdrawal
of the Judæans from the repasts enjoyed in
common by their fellow-citizens, their repugnance to
intermarriages with the heathens, their abhorrence
of the flesh of swine, and their abstinence from warm
food on the Sabbath, were considered as the outcome
of a perverse nature, whilst their keeping aloof from
intimate intercourse with any but their own coreligionists
was deemed a proof of their enmity
towards mankind in general. The serious nature
of the Judæans, which prevented their participation
in childish amusements and mimic combats, appeared
to those around them the sign of a gloomy disposition,
which could find no pleasure in the bright and
the beautiful. Superficial persons, therefore, regarded
Judaism only as a barbarous superstition,
which instilled hatred towards the generality of men,
whilst the more thoughtful and discerning were
filled with admiration by the pure and spiritual
worship of one God, by the affection and sympathy
which bound the Judæans together, and by the virtues
of chastity, temperance and fortitude which
characterized them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
Paganism, with the immoral life which sprang
from it, stood revealed in all its nakedness to the
keen sight of the Judæans. The dreary idolatry of
the heathen, with its fabulous mythology which made
divine nature even lower than the human, the madness
which allowed wicked emperors to be worshiped
as gods, the sensuality which had prevailed since
the fall of Greece and the closer connection of the
Romans with demoralized nations, the daily spectacle
of evil lives and broken marriage vows, the bacchanalian
intoxication of superstition, unbelief, and
bestialities, fostered the pride of the Judæans in their
own spiritual and intellectual possessions, and urged
them to make the superiority of Judaism over heathenism
manifest. In places where the Grecian language
facilitated exchange of thought, as in Egypt,
Asia Minor and Greece, there was considerable
mental friction between the Judæans and the heathens.
Judaism, as it were, summoned paganism to
appear before the tribunal of truth, and there placed
its own sublime faith beside the low, degrading forms
of belief of its adversary.</p>

<p>The Judæans were deeply anxious to impart the
burning convictions that filled their hearts to the
blind, deluded heathens, and to attain that object,
their religion being hated by the latter, some of the
most cultivated among the Judæans had recourse
to a sort of pious fraud, by which heathen poets and
soothsayers were made to bear witness to the beauty
and grandeur of Judaism. Skilful imitations in
verse, enunciating Judæan doctrines, were placed
by Judæan-Grecian writers in the mouth of the mist-shrouded
singer Orpheus, and introduced among
the strains of Sophocles, the tragic poet who had
celebrated the all-powerful gods. When Rome had
extended her empire far and wide, and the legends
of the prophetic Sibyls had become known through
many lands, Judæan poets hastened to make the
latter stand sponsors to tenets and views which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
they durst not proclaim themselves, or which, if
given in their own name, would have obtained no
hearing. In an oracular form the Sibyl was made
to reveal the deep meaning of Judaism, to stir the
hearts of the people by pictures of the awful result
of infidelity to God, and to offer to nations engaged
in bloody conflict the olive branch of peaceful amity,
opening out to them bright prospects of the happier
times, predicted by the Seers, to those who believed
in the eternal God of Judaism; and the Sibyl spoke
in prophetic strains of the glorious future, when all
the nations of the earth would rejoice in the blessings
of the Messianic kingdom.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Unhappy Greece, cease proudly to exalt thyself; offer prayers
for help to the immortal and lofty One, and take heed of thy ways.
Serve the mighty God, so that thou also mayest find thy portion
among the good when the end will have come and the day of judgment,
according to the will of God, will rise up before man. Then
will the teeming earth give abundantly to mortals the fairest fruits of
the vine and the olive and choicest nourishing seeds. Also sweet
honey dropping from heaven, and trees with their fruit, and fat sheep.
Likewise oxen and lambs and the kids of the goat. For them rivers
of milk will flow, sweet and white. The cities will be filled with
merchandise, the earth will be rich, and there will be no more war or
fearful sound of fighting. Nor will the earth, loud groaning, quake
and be rent. War will cease, and there will be no drought upon the
lands, no more famine or fruit-destroying hail. But great peace will
reign over all the world, and to the end of time each king will be the
other's friend, and under one law will the people of the whole world
be governed by the Eternal God, enthroned in the starry heavens&mdash;one
law for all weak, pitiable men; for He is one God, and there is
no other, and the wicked He will cast into the flames."</p></blockquote>

<p>The aim of a long series of prose writings of
the Judæan-Grecian school was to set forth the futility
and defects of paganism on the one hand, and
on the other to display Judaism in its most favorable
light, and thus to induce the heathen to become
acquainted with the tenets of the latter. Heathen
kings who had been convinced that idolatry was
empty and vain, and that by Judaism, on the contrary,
truth was revealed were pointed out as examples.</p>

<p>"The Book of Wisdom" was even more decided
and vigorous in its denunciations of paganism than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
the Sibylline writings. Its unknown author gave
with philosophical acumen, but in a poetical garb,
a truthful exposition of idolatry, showed it to be
the cause of vice and immorality, and then, in
marked contrast to these dark shadows, made Judaism
shine with increased purity and luster. It
was the wisdom of Judaism, embodied, as it were,
in the wise King Solomon, that presented these
views, and in his name, turning to the monarchs of
the earth (the Roman governors), rebukes their
shameless self-deification. "Love righteousness, ye
rulers of the earth," exclaims the Wisdom of Solomon,
"recognize the Lord in goodness, and seek
Him in simplicity of heart" (Book of Wisdom, i. 1).
According to this author, the invention of idols was
the cause of lasciviousness, and leads to the destruction
of life. Idolatry did not exist from the beginning,
neither will it last forever. It arose through
the vanity and ignorance of man, and would endure
but a short time. A father, suddenly plunged into
deepest grief by the death of a child, perhaps made
for himself an image of the latter; by degrees
he worshiped the lifeless figure as a god, and
insisted upon the observance by his dependants of
mystical rites in its honor. In the course of time
this godless practice became law, and images, by
the order of despots, received the worship of the
people. In the absence of the monarch, when he
could not be personally adored by his subjects, the
tyrant was flattered by the incense offered to his
image. The ambition of the artist also fostered the
growth of idolatry among the ignorant masses. To
please the potentates of the earth he strove to make
his images as beautiful as possible, and the public,
dazzled by the splendor and grace of the work,
worshiped as gods those whom they previously reverenced
as men. Such beautiful productions of art
became a snare to those whom misfortune or tyranny
had enslaved, and induced them to deify carved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
stone and wood, and to bestow on them the uncommunicable
name of God. Not alone do the people
err in their religious creed, but they live in constant
strife with one another and call it peace; infanticide
is celebrated as a rite, they observe dark, mysterious
ceremonies, and are guilty of unchastity.
Each one plays the part of spy on the other, or
wounds his friend in his dearest honor. All, without
distinction, thirst for blood, love plunder, and
practice cunning, perjury, deceit, ingratitude, and
every description of impurity. For the worship of
vain idols is the beginning, cause, and end of every
evil thing. "For health he calleth upon that which
is weak, for life prayeth to that which is dead, for
aid humbly beseecheth that which hath least means
to help" (Book of Wisdom, xiii. 18).</p>

<p>After the author has thus shown the vanity of
idolatry, he attempts to describe the fundamental
truths of Judaism:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"There is no God but Him whom the Jews adore. Divine wisdom
preserved the first-born, saved the righteous (Noah) from the flood,
upheld the righteous (Abraham) in innocence before God, delivered
the holy seed (the Judæan people) from the oppression of the nations,
filled the soul of the servant of God (Moses), who appeared before
kings with terrible signs and wonders. Israel is the upright one
whom God has chosen. He possesses the knowledge of the Divine
Being, and may call himself the Son of God, who in His mercy
sustains and upholds him."</p></blockquote>

<p>These righteous ones will have eternal life. When
Israel is persecuted by the rulers of the earth, because
his path lies apart from theirs, and he condemns
their godless ways, turns from them as unclean, and
calls God his Father; when the nations of the earth
torture him and put him to a shameful death&mdash;these
are only trials imposed by God on His chosen one,
to prove him and make him worthy of His grace.
He tries him like gold in the furnace, and accepts
him as a pure offering. Israel shall judge the
nations, and have dominion over the people, and
their God shall reign forever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Then will the upright one stand firmly before his oppressors.
They will be troubled with great fear; they will be amazed at his
glorious salvation, and repenting they will say, 'This was he whom
we had in derision, and of whom we made a laughing-stock. Ignorantly
we accounted his life madness, and his end to be without
honor. And now he is numbered among the children of God and his
lot is among the saints. We strayed from the way of truth, and the
light of righteousness did not shine for us.' Israel was the instrument
through which God gave the world the undying light of the law.
In all things did the Lord magnify His people and glorify them; He
abandoned them not, but assisted them in every time and place."
(Book of Wisdom.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Like the Babylonian Isaiah, the Alexandrian-Judæan
sage contemplated his ideal in Israel, of
whom a noble mission was required, and who would
hereafter shine in glory.</p>

<p>Whilst the Alexandrian Judæans were absorbed
in Grecian literature and philosophy, and were
using that melodious language as a weapon
against paganism and the immorality it fostered,
they were carried beyond the object they had
in view. Their desire was to make Judaism acceptable
to the cultivated Greeks, but in following
out that design it was, in some degree, lost
to themselves. Greek conceptions had so completely
taken possession of their thoughts that at
last they came to find in the teachings of Judaism
the current speculations of the Greeks. The faith
that they had inherited was, however, still dear to
them, and they managed, through sophistical means,
to deceive themselves into a belief of the genuineness
of their exposition. The Holy Scripture could
not, indeed, always offer apposite passages to the
prevailing philosophy, but the Judæan-Alexandrian
authors knew how to help themselves out of that
difficulty. They followed the example of Greek
writers, who found their own views of the world in
the poems of Homer, or put them there, and to
accomplish that feat, employed a peculiar kind of
sophistical word-pictures. Thus the Judæan thinkers
of that period, in their interpretations of the
Holy Scriptures, had recourse to allegory, and instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
of the plain, natural meaning of a work, often
gave it a different and seemingly higher import.
Starting with the assumption that the Scriptures
cannot always receive a literal explanation without
the divine glory's being tarnished and many biblical
characters being degraded, they resorted to the
arts of allegory and metaphor. This method became
so general that even the masses lost all
pleasure in the simple stories of the Holy Scriptures,
and took more delight in artificial explanations
than in the plain lessons and sublime laws
of their sacred books. The pious men, who were
wont to explain the Scriptures on the Sabbath,
were obliged, in compliance with the taste of the
time, to allegorize both the history and the lessons
contained in them. One result of this method
was the indifference that manifested itself among
the cultivated Judæans of Alexandria to the practice
of the religion of their fathers. Allegory undermined
the ramparts that fenced the Law. If
the latter was only the garment in which philosophical
ideas were robed, if the Sabbath was
merely intended to record the power of uncreated
divinity, and the rite of circumcision was only
meant to show the necessity of placing a curb on
the passions, it would be sufficient to understand
and adopt the ideas underlying those forms. Of
what use would be the practice of the latter?
From indifference to the practice of the laws to
the desertion of Judaism itself there was only one
step, and thus can be explained the apostasy to
paganism of some Judæans who were unable to
withstand the difficulties and constant pressure they
had to encounter. It was also among the Alexandrian
Judæans that the conflict between science
and faith first appeared.</p>

<p>The indifference towards Judaism was combated,
indeed, by many who had not wholly given themselves
up to Greek culture. Philo, the greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
genius which Alexandrian Judaism produced, opposed
the lukewarm spirit and the feelings of contempt
which had grown up against the practice of
the Law. In his elevated and inspired diction
he urged the obligation of adhering to the letter of
the Law, and induced his co-religionists to regard it
again with love and reverence. Philo indeed shared
some of the errors and prejudices of his contemporaries,
but with his clear intelligence, he soared above
the mists which enthroned them. He likewise made
exaggerated use of the allegorical method employed
by his predecessors, and agreed with them in applying
it to the entire Pentateuch, or at least to the
greater part of its history and laws. To carry out
this metaphorical line of scriptural interpretation he
devised symbolic numbers, explained Hebrew by
Greek words, and from one and the same sentence
deduced different and opposite conclusions. To
Philo allegorical exposition became almost a necessity.
Had he not already found it in use, he would
doubtless have invented it.</p>

<p>He wished to give the sanction of Holy Writ to
the great thoughts which were partly the productions
of his own rich mind, partly adopted from the
philosophical schools of the Academy, the Stoics
and the Neo-Pythagoreans. Sharing, and indeed,
surpassing in perversity the allegorical explanations
he found in vogue, he departed from them
just in that essential point which told against the
necessity of the practice of the Law, and in that lay
his chief importance. He expresses himself with
decision and force against those who, satisfied with
the spiritual meaning contained in the Law, are
indifferent to the Law itself. He calls them superficial
and thoughtless, acting as though they lived
in a desert, or as incorporeal beings who knew
neither of town nor village nor dwelling, or who, in
fact, entertained no intercourse with human beings,
despising what is dear to mankind, and seeking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
only abstract spiritual truths. The holy word, however,
while teaching us to seek out diligently the
deepest spiritual meaning of the Law, does not cancel
our obligation of adhering to customs introduced
by inspired men who were in all things infinitely
greater than ourselves. Shall we, because we know
the spiritual meaning of the Sabbath, neglect its
prescribed observance? "Shall we," he exclaims,
"make use of fire on the Sabbath, till the ground,
carry burdens, plead in courts of justice, enforce
the payment of debts, and, in fact, transact all our
usual daily business? Shall we, because a festival
symbolizes the peace of the soul, and is intended as
an expression of gratitude to God, cease to observe
the festival itself? Or shall we give up the rite of
circumcision now that we are acquainted with its
symbolic significance? In that case we should likewise
renounce our reverence for the sanctity of the
Temple and abandon many religious observances.
But, on the contrary, both the inner truth contained
in the Law, and the Law itself, should be equally
prized&mdash;the one as the soul, the other as the body.
Just as we take care of the body, looking upon it as
the habitation of the soul, so also should we value
the letter of the Law. By strict observance of the
Law we shall attain a clearer insight into its deepest
meaning, and shall likewise escape the remarks and
reproaches of the people."</p>

<p>It is in the Hebrew Scriptures, according to Philo,
that the most profound wisdom is contained. All
that is taught by the sublimest philosophy the Judæans
found in their precepts and customs&mdash;the
knowledge of the eternal God, the vanity of idols,
and the universal laws of humanity and kindness.
"Is not the highest honor due," he exclaims, "to
those laws which teach the rich to share their wealth
with the needy, which console the poor by enabling
them to look forward to the time when they will no
longer beg at the rich man's door, but will have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
recovered their alienated property; for, at the opening
of the seventh year, prosperity would return
again to the widow and the orphan, and would
restore to well-being those whom fortune had disinherited?"</p>

<p>In opposition to the abuse hurled against Judaism
by a Lysimachus and an Apion, Philo brings forward
the spirit of humanity which breathes through the
Judæan Law, and which affects even the treatment
of animals and plants. "And yet, though Judaism is
founded in truth on love, these miserable sycophants
accuse it of misanthropy and egotism." In order
to ensure a better comprehension of the Judæan
ethics by the cynics and lawbreakers of his own
race, as also by the Greeks, who had only a false
conception of Judaism, Philo arranged his writings
so that they should form a kind of philosophical
commentary on the Pentateuch, with the further
object that the truths of Judaism might be brought
within the province of philosophy.</p>

<p>But if, on the one hand, Philo stood firmly on Judæan
ground, on the other he was no less imbued
with the dogmas of the Grecian schools, which ran
counter to the former, and he seems to have been
equally swayed by the spirit of Judaism and that of
Greece. Vainly he attempted to bring the contradictory
ideas into harmony. They were so completely
opposed from their very inception that they
could not be reconciled. To solve the difficulty
between the conflicting views of a creating God and
a perfect deity who does not come into contact with
matter, Philo's system takes a middle course. God
created first the spiritual world of ideas, which were
not merely the archetypes of all future creations, but
at the same time active powers which formed the
latter. Through these spiritual powers which surround
God like a train of servitors, He works indirectly
in the world. Spiritual power acting, as it
were, intermediately between God and the world is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
according to Philo, the Logos, or creative reason,
the divine wisdom, the spirit of God, the source of
all strength. In Philo's more mystical than philosophical
description, the Logos is the first-born son
of God, who, standing on the border-land of the
finite and infinite, links both together. He is neither
uncreated like God, nor created like the things that
are finite. The Logos is the prototype of the universe,
the delegate of God, whose behests it communicates
to the world, the interpreter who reveals
His will and constantly accomplishes it, the archangel
who shows forth his works, the high priest
and intercessor between the world and God. Early
Christianity made use of this doctrine of the Logos
in order to assume a philosophic aspect.</p>

<p>The princely philosopher of the house of the
Alabarchs combated the Greek and Roman paganism,
steeped in vice and bestiality. His exposition
of the Judæan Law was designed to darken still
more, by comparison with the pure light of Judaism,
the shadows of idolatry, the sexual looseness, frivolity,
vanity and corruption which existed in the Grecian-Roman
world. He tried to show how false
were the accusations hurled against Judaism, and to
make known the sublime grandeur and beauty of its
tenets. His principal works were written for his
own people and co-religionists, though he frequently
addressed those who stood outside that circle.
Against the few laws of humanity which the Greeks
boasted to have possessed from ancient times, as,
for example that of granting fuel to any one requiring
it, or of showing a wayfarer the right path, Philo
could have no difficulty in enumerating a long array
of benevolent duties contained in Scripture or transmitted
by word of mouth. At the head of unwritten
laws he placed Hillel's golden saying, "What is
hateful to yourself do not unto others." Judaism
does not merely forbid any one to refuse fire or
water, but commands that what the poor and feeble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
require shall be given to them. It prohibits the use
of false weights and measures, the coinage of false
money. It does not allow children to be taken
from their parents, or wives to be separated from
their husbands, even when they have been legally
acquired as slaves. Even towards animals the duty
of mercy is impressed upon man. "What, in comparison
to these," he cries to the Greeks, "are the
few laws descending from primeval times, of which
you boast so much?"</p>

<p>In the following tone of mockery Philo answered
malicious accusations against the Lawgiver:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Yes, verily, Moses must have been a sorcerer, not only to have
preserved a whole people, and supplied them abundantly whilst they
were journeying through many nations, exposed to the danger of
hunger and thirst, and ignorant of the way they were pursuing, but
likewise to have made them, in spite of their mutinous spirit, which
often broke out against himself, docile and pliant."</p></blockquote>

<p>Of the three great moralists who followed each
other within a century, Hillel the Babylonian, Jesus
of Nazareth, and Philo the Alexandrian, it was the
last who in all things, great and small, upheld most
strenuously the glory of Judaism. He was superior
to them likewise in beauty of style and in depth of
thought, whilst he was animated with equally fervent
convictions. The first two simply created an impulse,
but it was through their disciples that their
ideas, variously transformed, were introduced into a
larger circle; whereas Philo, by his own eloquent
writings, made an important and lasting effect. His
works were perhaps read by cultivated heathens
even more than by Judæans, though all were affected
by the warmth and glow which pervaded everything
he wrote about God, Moses, and the spirit of the
Law.</p>

<p>Philo and the Alexandrian sages continued to
promote the great work of the prophets Isaiah,
Habakkuk and Jeremiah, and laid bare all the unreasonableness,
the instability, the perversion and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
immorality of the heathen religions. The transparent,
shimmering ether with which the Greeks
invested Olympus, these writers resolved into mists
and vapors. Greeks and Romans, who felt deeply
on the subject, were moved to turn with contempt
from a religion which not only gave so unworthy
a representation of the Divinity, but actually seemed
to sanctify immorality by the example set before
them in the history of their deities. Like most
oriental people, the heathens felt the need of religion,
and those who were searching for true and
elevated teaching embraced Judaism, which was daily
being brought more and more home to them in the
Greek translations of Judæan writings through
Greek-Alexandrine literature, and also through
intercourse with cultivated Judæans.</p>

<p>During the last ten years which preceded the
destruction of the Judæan State, there were more
proselytes than there had been at any other time.
Philo relates from his own experience that in his
native country many heathens, when they embraced
Judaism, not only changed their faith but their
lives, which were henceforth conspicuous by the
practice of the virtues of moderation, gentleness
and humanity. "Those who left the teachings in
which they had been educated, because they were
replete with lying inventions and vanities, became
sincere worshipers of the truth, and gave themselves
up to the practice of the purest piety." Above
all, the women, whose gentle feelings were offended
by the impurity of the mythological stories, seemed
attracted towards the childlike and sublime scenes
in Biblical history. The greater part of the women
in Damascus were converted to Judaism, and it is
related that in Asia Minor there were also many
female proselytes. Some over-eager Judæans may
have traveled with the intention of making converts,
as was proved in the story of the Roman patrician
Fulvia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
It was by similar zeal for conversion that the
Judæan faith was introduced into an Asiatic court,
the members of which remained steadfast adherents
to Judaism during several generations. Adiabene,
a province on the banks of the Tigris, situated where
once lay the Assyrian kingdom, was governed by a
royal pair, Monobaz and Helen. It was a small, but
not unimportant state, and although it touched the
great domains of Rome and Parthia, it had been
able to hold its independence during some centuries.
Monobaz had many children, the offspring both of
Helen and of other wives, but the youngest of all,
Izates, was the favorite of both parents. In order
that he should not suffer from the jealousy which
that favoritism had caused among the elder brothers,
Monobaz sent him to the court of a neighboring king,
of the name of Abinerglus (Abennerig), who was so
greatly pleased with the young prince confided to
his care, that he gave him his daughter in marriage.
A Judæan merchant by the name of Anania traded
at this court, and whilst he showed his merchandise
to the princesses, he dilated at the same time upon
the tenets of Judaism with such success that he
converted them to his faith. Izates, whose wife,
Samach, was one of the converts, became interested
in Anania, discoursed with him, and became a sincere
adherent of Judaism, which he openly embraced
in the year 18 <span class="smcap smaller">C.&nbsp;E.</span> His mother, the queen Helen,
had also, without the knowledge of her son, been won
over to Judaism. The deep impression which the
Judæan precepts had made upon the royal converts
was proved when the throne became vacant. The
dying Monobaz passed over his eldest sons and
named Izates as his successor. When Helen related
her husband's wishes to the nobles of Adiabene,
they suggested that the elder brothers should be
put to death, and thus prevent a civil war, to which
their hatred and jealousy might not improbably give
rise. But Helen, softened by her conversion to Judaism,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
would not follow this sanguinary advice, and
only kept the brothers in confinement, with the exception
of her eldest son, Monobaz II, to whom she
confided the regency. When Izates arrived at the
capital of Adiabene, and had, according to his
father's last testament, received the crown from the
hand of Monobaz, he considered it an unmanly act
of cruelty to leave his brothers to languish in confinement,
and he sent them as hostages into honorable
banishment, some to Rome and some to the
Parthian capital.</p>

<p>Once on the throne, Izates intended to adopt
Judaism, and even to submit to the rite of circumcision,
but he was dissuaded from doing so by his
mother, and by his physician, also named Anania,
who, being an Hellenic Judæan, represented to him
that the latter was not essential. Izates felt reassured
for the time; but another Judæan, a Galilæan
of the name of Eleazar, and a strict follower of
the Law, came to his court and offered a contrary
opinion. Eleazar, seeing the king engrossed
in reading the Pentateuch, probably a Greek
translation, could not help observing that to belong
to the Judæan faith it was not sufficient to
read the Law, but it was necessary also to
practise its precepts. Thereupon Izates, and, according
to some authorities, also his elder brother
Monobaz, secretly submitted to the rite of circumcision.
The queen-mother had anticipated
dangerous results from so decided a step, but
they were not immediately forthcoming. Not only
was there perfect peace after the accession of Izates,
but he was so much respected that he was chosen
to be arbitrator between the Parthian king Artaban
and the rebellious nobles of that monarch.</p>

<p>Some time later, when several of the king's relations
avowed their conversion to Judaism, some of
the nobles of Adiabene formed a conspiracy, and
secretly induced Abia, the king of Arabia, to declare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
war against him. Izates, however, was successful,
and Abia killed himself in despair. The nobles
then conspired with Vologeses, the king of Parthia,
to make war against their king, who had been faithless
to the religion of his forefathers. This war,
however, which might have been most calamitous
for Izates, Vologeses was prevented from undertaking,
and henceforth his reign, which lasted about
thirty years, continued undisturbed. Queen Helen,
fired by the enthusiasm of the Judæan faith, desired
to visit Jerusalem, and, accompanied by her son, she
accomplished this long journey in about the year 43.
Izates sent five of his own sons to Jerusalem to learn
the religion and the language of the Hebrews.</p>

<p>How grand and joyous must have been the welcome
offered by the inhabitants of Jerusalem to a
queen come from the far distant East with the sole
view of paying homage to their God and His Law!
Was not the word of prophecy fulfilled before their
very eyes, that the second Temple should be greater
than the first, inasmuch as the heathens should come
and worship the one God?</p>

<p>Helen soon had the opportunity of appearing as
the benefactress of the people. A famine prevailed
which created great distress in the country, and the
poorer classes especially suffered severely. Queen
Helen sought to relieve them by bringing from
Alexandria and Cyprus whole ship-loads of wheat
and figs, which she distributed among the starving
people (48 <span class="smcap smaller">C.&nbsp;E.</span>). Abundant means were given her
by Izates to carry out her generous impulses. Her
offering to the Temple consisted of a golden shell-shaped
portal for the door of the inner Temple,
to receive and reflect the first rays of the morning
sun, and thus announce the break of dawn to the
officiating priests.</p>

<p>The piety and benevolence of the proselyte Helen
were long remembered with love and gratitude by
the nation. She survived her son Izates, who died<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
at the age of fifty-five (55 <span class="smcap smaller">C.&nbsp;E.</span>); he is said to have
left twenty-four sons and the same number of daughters.
He was succeeded by his elder brother,
Monobaz II, who declared himself also to be a firm
adherent to Judaism. When Helen died, Monobaz
caused her remains, as well as those of his brother,
to be removed to Jerusalem, and to be buried within
the magnificent tomb which she had constructed
there during her lifetime. This mausoleum, which
was about thirty stadia north of Jerusalem, had beautiful
pillars of alabaster, and was considered a great
work of art. Helen had built a palace in the lower
part of the town, and her granddaughter, the Princess
Grapte, erected another in that part of Jerusalem
known as Ophla. Monobaz, who also had his
palace in Jerusalem, had golden vessels made for
use in the Temple on the Day of Atonement. The
people of Adiabene remained firm friends of the
Judæan nation, and were always ready to give their
powerful help in times of danger.</p>

<p>This leaning towards Judaism, evinced by so
many religiously inclined heathens, was utilized by
the teachers of the Nazarene creed. They took
advantage of and worked upon this enthusiasm, and
thus laid the first step to their future conquest of
the world.</p>

<p>Two Judæans, both coming from countries where
the Greek language was spoken, Saul of Tarsus
(known as Paul) and Jose Barnabas of Cyprus, declared
their intention of proselytizing the heathen.
They thus widened the sphere of the small community,
and raised it from being an insignificant sect
of Judaism to the position of a distinct and separate
religious body, but in order to do so they were
obliged to change its original character and purpose.</p>

<p>During the short decade following the death of
its founder the small community had been augmented
by Essenes and some Judæan inhabitants of
Greek countries. The former, who had hitherto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
lived in a mystic land of visions and trusted to
miraculous intervention for the arrival of the kingdom
of heaven, may have seen their dreams fulfilled
in the advent of Jesus. The Essenes, who had no
families, were obliged to augment their numbers
from without. They could only add to the community
by dint of mystical persuasions, and, as
believing followers of Jesus, they continued their
propaganda and attracted new adherents from the
lower classes, whom the leaders of the Pharisees
had neglected or avoided. Their untiring zeal incited
the activity of the first Christians, who had been
awaiting, not so much an increase of believers, as
the speedy re-appearance of Jesus, enthroned in the
clouds of heaven. Apostles were now sent out
from Jerusalem, where they were chiefly established,
to propagate the belief that Jesus was the true Messiah.
In order, however, to gain many converts, a
greater power of oratory was required than the
simple fishermen and mechanics of Galilee possessed.
This want was supplied by the addition of
Greek-speaking Judæans. From Asia Minor, Egypt,
Cyrene, from the islands of Crete and Cyprus, there
was an annual pilgrimage of Judæans to Jerusalem
at the time of the Passover festival. Besides men
of piety and enthusiasts, there were adventurers,
seekers after novelty, and beggars, ignorant of the
Law. Of these pilgrims, numbers eagerly adopted
the new faith. Many adventurers among the Greek
Judæans were easily persuaded to accept the doctrine
of the community of goods, which the Ebionite
Christians had retained from their Essene origin, and
which found great favor with these homeless wanderers.
All those who possessed any property sold it to
increase the contents of the general treasury, and
those who were utterly impecunious lived without
any cares in the community. These Greek Judæans,
who had learnt from their heathen neighbors the
art of speaking on every subject, and even of veiling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
almost meaningless expressions in an attractive and
persuasive manner, presented the new religion in
an attractive form. They were best adapted to
become the preachers and missionaries. When
converted themselves, they used all their efforts to
convert others. The Greek element soon predominated
over the Galilæan, Ebionite and Essene
elements, of which the community had previously
been composed.</p>

<p>These Greek Judæans, who had never been
taught the Law in the schools of Jerusalem and
were, indeed, generally ignorant of its tenets, transgressed
them, sometimes unwillingly, but at times
intentionally. When taken to task they justified
their actions by the belief which they entertained in
the Messianic character of Jesus, who, they alleged,
had also put aside the authority of the Law. In
Jerusalem, still considered as the holy city, each
practice and observance was made a matter of deep
importance. People began to suspect that the
Nazarenes, who spoke in foreign tongues, were
introducing innovations and endeavoring to bring
the Law into contempt, and the disciples of Jesus
were thenceforth watched, and their utterances in
the synagogues and in the market-places were
carefully noted. Amongst those who were most
fanatical against the Nazarenes was Saul of Tarsus,
a zealous follower of the Pharisaic school, who held
that no edict of either the oral or the written Law
might be tampered with. As he spoke Greek himself,
he was able to measure the boldness of the
utterances of the Judæan-Christian Greeks who were
in Jerusalem, and his indignation was great against
them. One of these Greeks, of the name of Stephen,
was particularly violent in his attacks, and had recklessly
spoken against the holiness of the Law and
the Temple. It appears that Saul proclaimed him
to be a blasphemer, and that he was stoned, whether
after a judicial trial or by an angry populace is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
known. After that time the Nazarenes were viewed
with still greater suspicion, and were called upon to
defend themselves; and again it was Saul who
watched the proceedings of these Greek adherents
of the new sect, and caused them to be brought up
for trial. They were imprisoned, and those who
were found guilty of contempt of the Law by their
belief in the Messianic attributes of Jesus were not
punished by death, but were sentenced to be
scourged. The foreign Nazarenes, terrified by this
severity, hastened away from Jerusalem and dispersed
in various Greek towns in which there dwelt
Judæan communities, among whom they continued
their work of proselytizing. Those followers of
Jesus, however, who, notwithstanding their new
faith, did not deny the holiness of the Law, remained
unmolested. Their three leaders, James, a brother
or a relation of Jesus, Kephas or Peter, and John,
son of Zebedee, lived at Jerusalem without fear of
persecution.</p>

<p>The other Nazarenes zealously continued the
work of conversion in foreign places. Homeless
themselves, they endeavored to introduce into
their circle of followers the doctrine of the community
of goods, which would enable them to live on
from day to day without care or thought for the
morrow. They were particularly attracted towards
the towns of Antioch and Damascus, where they
found a large field for their labors in the Greek-speaking
community of men and women. The half-educated
multitude listened eagerly to the words of
messengers who announced that a heavenly kingdom
was at hand, and to enter it they must accept
only baptism, and the belief that Jesus was the
Messiah who had actually appeared, had been crucified,
and had risen again.</p>

<p>Soon these two Greek cities saw a Nazarene
community settling within their walls, who seemed
to be Judæans, who lived according to Judæan rule,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
who prayed, sang psalms, and ended their songs of
praise with the customary "Amen"; but who yet
showed certain signs of forming a new sect. They
assembled together at a meal which they called
Agape, spoke the blessing over the wine, drank
after one another from the same vessel, broke their
bread in remembrance of the last hours of Jesus,
and gave each other, men and women indiscriminately,
the kiss of peace. Then, in convulsive excitement,
some arose and prophesied, others spoke
in strange tongues, whilst others again effected
miraculous cures in the name of Jesus. An unnatural
and highly wrought state of enthusiasm prevailed
in these Greek-Nazarene circles, which would
probably have been deemed ridiculous, and would
have evaporated in time; in short, Christianity
might have died a noiseless death, if Saul of Tarsus
had not appeared, and given it a new direction, a
great scope, and thereby imparted to it vital powers
and vigor. Without Jesus, Saul would not have
made his vast spiritual conquests, but without Saul,
Christianity itself would have had no stability.</p>

<p>Saul (born in Tarsus in Cilicia, at the beginning
of the Christian epoch, and belonging to the tribe
of Benjamin) had a very remarkable nature. Weak
and fragile in body, he was possessed of a tenacity
which nothing could daunt. He was excitable and
vehement, could not endure any opposition to his
opinions, and was one-sided and bitter in his treatment
of those who differed from him in the slightest
degree. He had a limited knowledge of Judæan
writings, and was only familiar with the Scriptures
through the Greek translation; enthusiastic and
fanciful, he believed in the visions of his imagination
and allowed himself to be guided by them. In
short, Saul combined a morbid and an iron nature;
he seemed created to establish what was new, and
to give form and reality to that which seemed impossible
and unreal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
He had persecuted the Greek Nazarenes, hunted
them out of their haunts of concealment to give
them over to punishment, because they had seceded
from Pharisaic Judaism. But that did not suffice.
Hearing that some of them were established in
Damascus, he followed them thither with all zeal,
intending, with implacable persecuting zeal, to exterminate
the community. But his disposition towards
them suddenly changed. In Damascus many heathens,
particularly many of the female population, had
gone over to Judaism. The conversion of the royal
house of Adiabene had caused much excitement.
Saul had probably himself witnessed the great triumph
of Judaism, the entry of Queen Helen, the
Princes of Adiabene and their retinue into Jerusalem.
She probably stayed in Damascus on her
journey, and there must have received the thanks
of the Judæan inhabitants of that city. These
events must have made a deep impression on Saul,
and may have given rise to the thought: Had not
the time foreseen by the prophets now arrived,
when every nation should recognize the God of
Israel, bow down and swear allegiance to Him
alone?</p>

<p>If he was occupied with these thoughts he must
also have been prepared to wrestle with many
doubts to which they gave rise. Would it be possible
to convert the heathen world if the Law were
to bind them with its trammels, if they were to be
forced to observe the Sabbath and the festivals, to
keep the dietary laws, to distinguish between the
clean and the unclean, and even to submit to circumcision?
Should the heathen be required to
follow even the severe Pharisaic ordinances? In
that case it would be impossible that other nations
should enter the Judæan community. But, on
the other hand, could not the Law be abrogated
for the sake of the heathens, and might they not
merely be taught the knowledge of God and a loftier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
morality? Yet, as the whole law originated from
God, by whom it was revealed, and who had expressly
commanded that it should be fulfilled, how
could it be set aside? A saying of his teachers may
then have occurred to Saul, that the Law was only
binding until the time of the Messiah, and that as
soon as the Redeemer came its importance and significance
would cease. If the Messiah had really
appeared, then all the difficulties that surrounded
the conversion of the heathen would disappear.
This train of thought engrossed the mind of Saul.
His nervous temperament and imaginative nature
easily dispelled all doubts, and he believed firmly
and truly that Jesus had made himself manifest to
him. Much later he said of the vision which had
appeared: "If it were in the flesh I know not, if it
were supernatural I know not, God knows; but I
was carried up beyond the third heaven." This is
not very reliable evidence to an actual fact. Legend
has adorned this conversion, which was of such great
importance to Christianity, in a fitting manner. It
describes Saul traveling to Damascus, and his path
illumined by a great light. Beholding this light, he
is said to have fallen in terror to the earth, and to
have heard a voice, which called to him, "Saul, Saul,
why dost thou persecute me?" Blinded by the
vision, he reached Damascus; and after an interview
with a Christian, who advised him to be baptized,
the scales at length fell from his eyes.</p>

<p>With the certainty that he had actually beheld
Jesus, another doubt was banished from Saul's mind,
or a different Messianic point of view was revealed to
him. Jesus had certainly died&mdash;or rather had been
crucified&mdash;but, as he appeared to Saul, he must
have risen from the dead; he must have been the
first who had been brought to life again, and had
therefore confirmed the fact that there would be a
Resurrection, which fact had been a matter of contention
between the various schools: and Jesus had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
also thereby announced the advent of the kingdom
of heaven, of which, as the prophet Daniel had predicted,
the resurrection of the dead was to be the
forerunner. Thus the former Pharisee of Tarsus
was firmly convinced of three things&mdash;that Jesus
had arisen; that he was the true Messiah who had
been predicted; and that the kingdom of heaven,
the period of the resurrection, was near, and that
the then existing generation, or rather the true
believers in Jesus, would soon witness its arrival.
This belief led to further results. If the Messiah
had already appeared, or if Jesus were actually the
Christ, then the Law was of itself abrogated, and
the heathens could participate in the blessing of
Abraham, without observing the Law. This belief
acted as an incentive to Saul. He felt himself
called upon to convert the depraved world of
heathendom, and, through Christ, to lead it back to
the Father of all. No time was allowed to elapse
between the inception of this idea and its realization.
Assuming the name of Paul, he joined the Nazarenes
of Damascus, who were not a little astonished
that their persecutor had now become their colleague,
and was seeking to make fresh converts.</p>

<p>Paul found many opportunities for converting in
Damascus, as a strong feeling in favor of Judaism
prevailed there, and the sacrifice incumbent on its
followers alone kept many aloof. The newly-converted
Apostle could render this step easier, as he
relieved them of all duties to the Law by means of
a belief in Jesus. He does not, however, seem to
have found a warm reception for his faith, resting as it
did on sophistry, even amongst his own countrymen.
His theory that the whole Law might be set aside
was probably not considered as quite acceptable.
The people also seem to have felt distrust of their
former persecutor. In short, Saul-Paul could not
maintain his ground in Damascus, and fled to
Arabia (Auranitis), where Judæan communities also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
existed. When, however, he returned to Damascus
for the second time, and his coreligionists had acquired
greater confidence in him, he could indulge
his love of proselytism. But his brusque, inconsiderate
manner, and his assertion that the Law was
no longer in force, aroused the Judæan community
of Damascus against him. The Judæan ethnarch
of the town, who had been appointed or confirmed
by Aretas Philodemus, sought to take him prisoner.
His companions saved him, by lowering him in a
basket from a window in the wall. Thus he escaped
from those who rightly considered him as the destroyer
of Judaism. He returned to Jerusalem
three years after his conversion. He felt that there
was a wide difference between himself and the Galilæan
Christians, and that he would not be able to
make terms with them. Paul was filled with the
one thought, that the blessing for all generations,
the promise (evangel) made to Abraham that he
should be father of many nations, and that the
wealth of the heathen should belong to the children
of Abraham, was now finally to be realized, and that
he (Paul) was called upon to effect this work. He
wished to put an end to the difference between the
Judæans and the Greeks, between slaves and freemen,
and to make all brothers in the covenant of
Abraham&mdash;as the seed of Abraham&mdash;according to
the promise given in by-gone years. This was the
glad message which he brought to the people; it
was a far-reaching thought, of which the Ebionites
in Jerusalem and the so-called main Apostles had no
understanding.</p>

<p>After a short stay in Jerusalem, Saul, accompanied
by his disciple, the Cyprian Joseph Barnabas, repaired
to Cilicia, Paul's native place, and traversed
Asia Minor and Macedonia to Achaia. There his
endeavors were crowned with marvelous results.
He founded in various places Greek-Christian communities,
especially in Galatia, in Ephesus, Philippi,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
and Thessalonica, and in the town of Corinth. This
result may partly be laid to the credit of Judaism;
for when Paul wished to win over the heathens, he
had to unfold to them the glorious past of the Judæan
nation, in order to speak of Jesus. He also
had to contrast the pure belief in God with the wild
practices of heathendom. He found a susceptibility
for the pure teachings of Judaism among the heathen.
Not a few felt disgust at the mythological stories of
the gods and the deification of human beings. The
remembrance was yet fresh in their memories how
all nations of the Roman kingdom, with unexampled
abjectness, had dedicated altars to the monster Caligula,
and had recognized and worshiped him as a
god. Despairing and pure spirits sought a God to
whom they might elevate themselves, but they did
not find him. Now Paul had come and brought them
this God, surrounded, it is true, with wonderful stories,
which, however, pleased them, on account of the
mythological strain in them. The heathen nations
could better comprehend the "Son of God" than
the "Messianic Redeemer." The wide-spread disease
of immorality, which was rife throughout the
Roman empire, rendered the Judæan teachings
acceptable and proper. Paul's orations, delivered
with the fire of enthusiasm, and uttered by one
who threw his whole soul into his words, could not
fail to make an impression on the better-disposed
and purer-minded heathens. To this was added
the fear of the approach of the end of the world,
which Paul, through his firm belief in the resurrection
and reappearance of Jesus, had transformed
into the hope that the dead would arise, in refulgent
form, at the trumpet-call, and that the living would
be carried up into heaven in a cloud.</p>

<p>Thus Paul appealed to the imagination of many
heathens in his apostolic wanderings from Jerusalem
to Illyria. At first he aroused only people
of the lower classes, slaves, and especially women,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
by his glad tidings. To the cultivated Greeks
the Christianity which Paul preached, based on
the so-called resurrection of Jesus, appeared as
a ridiculous absurdity. The Judæans were naturally
displeased with him. Paul's chief topics,
on which he dilated to the heathens whom he
wished to convert, were the Judæan nation, Judæan
writings, and the Judæan Law; without these his
preaching about a Messiah or salvation had no
foundation. The Greeks must have been told about
Israel and Jerusalem, or his words would have fallen
on deaf ears. He, therefore, could only resort to
those towns where Judæan communities dwelt, from
whom the heathen nations had received some faint
notion of the history and doctrines of Judaism.</p>

<p>Paul's efforts were directly aimed at destroying the
bonds which connected the teachings of Christ with
those of Judaism. He therefore inveighed against
the Law, as it proved a hindrance to the reception
of heathen proselytes. He asserted that it was
detrimental to the pursuit of a higher spiritual life
and to following the way of truth. Paul not only
disapproved of the so-called ceremonial laws of
Judaism, but also of those relating to morality. He
affirmed that without laws men would not have given
way to their evil desires. "Thou shalt not covet"
had first aroused covetousness; thus through the
Law the knowledge of sin had arisen. Man is
sensual and inclined to sin, for flesh is weak
and inclined to resist the Law. Paul set up a new
teaching. He maintained that man had only become
sensual, weak and sinful because the first
man had sinned. Adam's fall had given birth to an
inextinguishable hereditary sin, and by this means
death had come upon humanity. The Law was not
able to overcome this hereditary sin. In order to
destroy sin and death, God had made a special
dispensation. He had given up the Messiah, His
son, to death, and again re-animated him, and he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
become the second Adam, who was to obliterate
hereditary sin, to conquer death, and establish everlasting
life. Thus the Redeemer, instead of bringing
about the redemption of nations from the yoke
imposed on them, had redeemed them from sin.</p>

<p>Paul therefore conceived Christianity to be the
very opposite of Judaism. The one was founded on
law and compulsion, the other owed its origin to
freedom and grace. Jesus or Christianity had
brought about the holy state foretold by the prophets.
The ancient times had departed, and a new
state of things had arisen; the old covenant (Testament)
must yield to the new one; Abraham himself
had not been judged as just through the Law, but
through faith. Thus Paul sophistically explained the
Scriptures. From the Law it is to be inferred that
whosoever does not abide by it, and refuses
wholly and entirely to comply with its precepts,
stands under a curse. The great service which
Jesus had rendered was that he had delivered all
men from this curse, for through his means the Law
had been set aside. How could the Judæans
submit to this open desecration of the Law of
Sinai for which their forefathers had suffered death,
and for which, but a short time since, under
Caligula, they had determined to sacrifice their
lives? It is not to be wondered at that they rose
against the man who despised the Law, and persecuted
him. They, however, contented themselves
with flogging Paul when he fell into their
hands, but they left his life unharmed; five
times, as he himself relates, he was chastised
with thirty-nine strokes. Not only the Judæans
but also the Nazarenes, or Judæan Christians, were
incensed against Paul for his attack on the Law,
and by this means dissension and schisms arose in
the midst of young Christianity. Peter, or Kephas,
who came as a messenger to the Judæans, taught a
Christianity which differed from that of Paul, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
that of the other Apostles who sought to make
converts amongst the heathen; whilst Apollos from
Alexandria, and a certain Chrestus preached another
version.</p>

<p>The Judaic Christians saw with terror the fruits
of the ceremonial freedom preached by Paul in
the communities founded by him in Corinth and
Ephesus, where every species of vice and immorality
was rife. Other Apostles, therefore, followed
Paul, and proclaimed his teachings full of
error and misrepresentation, and maintained that
the Law of Judaism was binding on Christians,
as it was only by this Law that the lower passions
could be held in check. In Antioch a violent
quarrel arose between Paul and the Judaic-Christian
Apostle. Peter, who till then had disregarded
the dietary laws and eaten at one table with
the heathens, was censured by the leaders of the
severe party of the Apostle James, and was now
obliged to acknowledge his fault, and to speak
openly against Paul's contempt of the Law. Paul,
on the other hand, reproached him with hypocrisy.
The influence of the severe, Law-loving Judaic
Christians was, however, so great that all the Judæan
Christians of Antioch gave up eating at the
tables of the heathen, and their example was even
followed by Barnabas, the disciple of Paul.</p>

<p>Racial feelings also helped to widen the breach
between the two parties. The Greek Christians
despised the Judaic Christians in the same way
as the Hellenes had looked down upon the Judæans.
Paul sent out violent epistles against the
adherents of the Law, and laid a curse on those
who preached salvation in a manner differing
from his own. These did not spare him either,
and related how he had loved the daughter of a
high priest; how, on being despised by her, he
had in disgust written against circumcision, the
Sabbath, and the Law. Thus, within barely thirty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
years after the death of its founder, Christianity
was split into two parties, namely, a Judaic-Christian
and a heathen-Christian sect. The Judaic Christians
remained attached to the foundations of Judaism,
compelled their converts to adhere to the Law, and
clung to Jerusalem, where they awaited the return
of the Messiah. The heathen Christians, on the
other hand, separated themselves more and more
from Judaism, and took up an inimical position
towards it.</p>

<p>Whatever triumph Judaism might celebrate by the
accession of proselytes, and bright as seemed the
dawn of the day predicted by the prophet, when
the peoples of the earth would turn their eyes to
Zion, and towards the light issuing thence to illumine
the human race, yet in their native land, and
more especially in Jerusalem, the yoke of the
Romans weighed heavily on the Judæans, and became
daily more oppressive.</p>

<p>The pitiable state of existing affairs crushed
down all joyful feelings as to the prospective dominion
of Judaism. A veil of sadness had for the
last twenty years been spread over the nation, and
no joyful feelings could exist beneath it. The last
decades exhibit the nation as a captive who, continually
tormented and goaded on by his jailer,
tugs at his fetters, with the strength of despair,
until he wrenches them asunder. The bloody contest
between Rome, strong in arms and fertile in
stratagem, and Judæa, poor in outward means of
warfare and powerful only through indomitable
will, inspires the deepest interest because, in spite
of the disproportion between the combatants, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
weak daughter of Zion would probably have gained
the victory had she not been torn by conflicting
parties and surrounded by treachery. Perhaps, had
she awaited a more favorable moment, success
might have been hers; but Providence had decreed
the destruction of her national life.</p>

<p>This great combat, to which few struggles in
the history of the world are comparable, was
waged not merely for liberty, like the wars in
which the Gauls, Germans, and Britons were engaged
against Rome, but had likewise a religious
character. The Judæan people were daily wounded
in their religious sentiments by the arbitrary rule
of Rome, and desired to gain their independence
in order to acquire and maintain the free exercise
of their religion. Such being their aim, the frequent
reverses they sustained could not abate the
ardent longing they felt to be free; on the contrary,
it rose with each fresh disaster, and in the
most trivial circumstances they saw and resented
an attack upon their most sacred convictions. It was
seldom, indeed, that Rome outraged the religious
feelings of the Judæans as she had done under
Caligula; on the contrary, she rather indulged their
susceptibilities, but she often wounded them unintentionally
through her despotic and jealous supervision.</p>

<p>The higher classes, poisoned by the seductive
arts of Rome, had become deaf to the voice of
duty, and the wise and vigilant among the nation
feared, with reason, that the whole body would be
infused with the moral prostration of its highest
members. The aristocratic families were, indeed,
so deeply steeped in immorality that the middle
classes could hardly escape its contaminating influence.
The bad example was set by the last members
of the house of Herod, who were educated
either in Rome itself or in the small courts of the
princely Roman vassals. Agrippa II (born 27,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
died 91&ndash;93), son of the last noble Judæan king
Agrippa I, a mere stripling of seventeen years
at the time of his father's death, drank in the poisoned
air of the Roman court, where the Messalinas
and Agrippinas openly displayed the most hideous
vices. After the demise of Herod II, the Emperor
Claudius gave Agrippa the tiny kingdom of Chalcis
(about 50). It was whispered that this last
scion of the Hasmonæan and Herodian houses led
an incestuous life with his beautiful sister Berenice,
who was a year younger than himself, and a widow
on the death of her husband, Herod II. There
was probably some truth in the rumor, as Agrippa
found himself forced to silence it. He betrothed
his sister to Polemon, king of Cilicia, who, perhaps
allured by her wealth even more than by her
beauty, adopted Judaism to obtain her hand. But
impelled by her inconstant humor, Berenice soon
left Polemon, and was free again to indulge in her
licentious intrigues.</p>

<p>Agrippa's second sister, Mariamne II (born 34),
married to a native of Palestine, Julius Archelaus,
dissolved that union, though she had borne him
a daughter, and became the wife of the Judæan
Demetrius of Alexandria, probably the son of the
Alabarch Alexander, and in that case the brother
of the apostate Tiberius Alexander. Still more
depraved was his youngest sister, the beautiful
Drusilla (born 38). Her father had promised her,
when still a child, to the prince Epiphanes, the son of
his friend Antiochus of Commagene, but only upon
condition of his becoming a convert to Judaism.
After Agrippa's death, however, Epiphanes refused
to accept Judaism, and the young Agrippa gave his
sister Drusilla to Aziz, king of Emesa, who declared
himself willing to embrace her faith. Heedless,
however, of conjugal duty, Drusilla soon abandoned
her husband, married a Roman, the Governor Felix,
and for his sake gave up her faith and became a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
pagan. The envy with which Berenice inspired
Drusilla was supposed to have been the motive of the
infidelity of the younger sister both to her husband
and to her religion.</p>

<p>Although Agrippa was only prince of Chalcis, he
was looked upon as the king of Judæa. Rome certainly
had not deprived him of the royal title, but had
divested him of all power, and made use of him only as
a pliant tool and as a guard upon the movements of
the surrounding nations. Agrippa was devoted to
the imperial house, styling himself the emperor's
friend. He displayed weakness and impotency when
it behooved him to put bounds to the usurpations,
insolence, and arrogance of Rome, and only showed
his strength when he opposed the struggles of his
people to regain their freedom and liberty. The
whole house of Agrippa, including his most distant
connections, Antipas and the two brothers Costobar
and Saul, were all immoral, rapacious, and hostile
to their own people. The only authority which
Claudius, or rather his council, had left in the hands
of the titular king, and which was ratified by his successors,
was that which he was allowed to exercise
over the Temple, and which enabled him to appoint
the high priest. It was not religious zeal or moral
worth that swayed Agrippa in the choice of the high
priest, but simply the sentiments felt by the candidate
for that office towards Rome. He who carried
servility and the surrender of national aspirations
furthest gained the prize. In barely twenty years
Agrippa had named at least seven high priests.
Among that number was Ananias (son of Eleazar?),
whose enormous wealth, either acquired or inherited,
allowed him to ingratiate himself with all who were
open to bribery, and set him free to practise acts of
lawlessness and violence. Since the time when
Herod had lowered the dignity of the high priest's
office by permitting it to be sold or gained by
pandering to most degraded sentiments, there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
certain families who seemed to have acquired a
right to it&mdash;those of Boëthus, Cantheras, Phabi,
Camith, and Anan or Seth, and it was but seldom
that any one was elected outside that circle. The
members of these families vied with each other in
dishonorable conduct and frivolous thoughtlessness.
Often their fierce jealousy broke out in acts
of violence, and the streets of Jerusalem occasionally
were the scenes of bloody skirmishes between
the followers of those hostile rival houses. Each
succeeding high priest tried to gain as much as possible
out of his office, giving&mdash;heedless of the worth
or fitness of the recipient&mdash;the most lucrative places
in the Temple to his relatives and friends. So
reckless were the high priests in the use, or rather
abuse, of their power, that they would send their
slaves, armed with clubs, to the barns to seize for
themselves the tithes which every one was legally
free to give to whichever priest he might select.
Those priests who had not the good fortune to be
related to the high priest were thus deprived of the
means of subsistence, and fell into stringent poverty.
Avarice and greed of power were the mainsprings
of the actions of those who were elected to represent
the highest ideal of morality; the Temple was
despoiled by its dignitaries even before the enemy
forced his way into it with his weapons of murder.</p>

<p>From this time, according to tradition, the visible
signs of divine mercy ceased to appear in the Temple.
Like some cankerous affection, this demoralization
of princes and high priests extended ever more
and more to the classes closest to them, producing
evils which are depicted in dark colors by the pen of
a contemporary. Since the penal laws were administered
in the name of the emperor, and were placed
under the control of the governors, the judiciary
became dependent upon the Romans and the
wealthy and influential classes. Selfishness, bribery,
calumny, and cowardice, according to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
painter of the manners and morality of that period,
were ever increasing. "They throw off," he bitterly
exclaims, "the yoke of heaven, and place themselves
under the yoke of men; their judgments are false
and their actions perverse. The vain and thoughtless
are made great, while the nobler citizens are
despised." Frivolity in the women and licentiousness
in the men were so completely the order of
the day that the most eminent teacher of morality
of that time, Jochanan ben Zaccai, found himself
obliged to abolish the ritual hitherto used in cases of
suspicion of adultery. With deep sorrow, the nobler-minded
Judæans lamented a state of things in
which outward forms of worship stood higher than
morality, and the defiling of the Temple caused
more scandal and wrath than an act of murder. In
the lower classes, crime of another but of a not less
alarming nature appeared. The frequent insurrections
which had been stimulated and fomented by
the Zealots since Rome had arrogantly treated
Judæa like a conquered province, had given rise
to bands of free troops, which roved wildly about the
country, confounding liberty with licentiousness,
and trampling upon both customs and laws. They
crowded the caves and hollows which abound in the
rocky mountains of Judæa, and from those retreats
made frequent irruptions to gratify their love of
unbridled liberty. Some bands of Zealots, led by
Eleazar ben Dinai and Alexander, were incited by
feelings of patriotism to deeds of cruelty. They
had sworn destruction and death to the Romans,
and they included among the latter all those who
consorted with them; they would not recognize
them as Judæans, and deemed it no crime to plunder
and destroy them. The degenerate friends of
Rome were, according to their views, and the oaths
they had taken, mere outlaws, and the Zealots kept
their oath only too well. They attacked the nobles
as often as they fell in their way, ravaged their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
possessions and did them as much harm as lay in
their power. If there was any wrong to be avenged
upon the enemy of their country, they were the first
to lend their sword in defense of their outraged
nationality.</p>

<p>Another band of Zealots, grown wild and savage,
forgot the original aim of liberating their country,
and turned their attacks upon the foes of the latter
into profit for themselves. They were called Sicarii,
from the short dagger "sica," which they wore concealed
under their cloaks, and with which, either
openly or insidiously, they struck and killed their
enemies. The Sicarii belonged to the very refuse
of the Zealots. Later they acknowledged the grandsons
of Judas of Galilee, Menahem and Eleazar ben
Jair, as their leaders, but at the commencement of
this epoch they were under no discipline whatever.
They wandered about the country without any
defined object, lending their assistance to those who
either offered them a reward or an opportunity for
satisfying their thirst for revenge. Armed with
daggers, they wandered among the various groups
that thronged the colonnade of the Temple during
the festivals, and unperceived, struck down those
they had marked out as their victims. These murders
were committed with such extraordinary rapidity
and skill, that for a long time the assassins remained
undiscovered, but all the greater were the dread
and horror excited by those dark, mysterious deeds.
Murders became so frequent that Jochanan ben
Zaccai and the teachers of the Law found it necessary
to abrogate the sin-offering for the shedding
of innocent blood, as too many animals would have
been slaughtered for the human victims. It may
have been about this time that the Great Synhedrion,
which witnessed with intense grief the constant increase
of lawlessness and immorality, gave up its
functions and transferred its place of meeting from
the Hewn-stone Hall to the Commercial Hall in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
Bethany, an act which seemed to imply its dissolution.</p>

<p>To stem, if possible, the confusion and disorder
which existed, the noblest citizens combined, and
keeping aloof from conflicts and strifes, sought to
further by all means in their power the spiritual
advancement of Judaism. To keep the Law intact
was their self-imposed, sacred task. In Jochanan
ben Zaccai they found a fitting representative. He
was considered, next to the president of the Synhedrion,
Simon ben Gamaliel (and perhaps even before
him), as the greatest teacher of that time. On
account of his deep knowledge of the Law and of
the worth and dignity of his character, Jochanan
ben Zaccai was made vice-president of the Synhedrion.
That position gave him the power to cancel
such laws as could not be enforced in that stormy
period. His chief office, however, was that of
teacher. In the cool shade cast by the Temple
walls, he sat, encircled by his disciples, to whom he
delivered the laws that were to be observed, and
expounded the Scriptures.</p>

<p>Besides the spirit of anarchy there was another
source of discord and misery. As the existing
situation became more and more sad and hopeless,
the longing in the hearts of faithful believers for the
expected deliverer who was to bring peace to
Judæa became more and more intense. Messianic
hopes were rifer among the people now than they
had been even during the time of the first Roman
governors; and these hopes stirred up enthusiasts
who proclaimed themselves to be prophets and Messiahs,
and who inspired belief and obtained followers.
Freedom from the yoke of Rome was the one great
aim of all these enthusiasts. What the disciples of
Judas attempted to bring about by force of arms, the
disciples of Theudas hoped to accomplish without
fighting, having recourse only to signs and miracles.
A Judæan from Egypt calling himself a prophet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
found no less than three, or according to another
account, four thousand followers. These he summoned
to the Mount of Olives, and there promised
to overthrow the walls of Jerusalem with the breath
of his mouth and to defeat the Roman soldiers.
He was not the only one who, carried away by the
fervor of desire, prophesied the approach of better
times. And well may those enthusiasts have found
acceptance among the people. A nation that had
enjoyed so rich a past and looked forward even to
a more glorious future, might allow itself to be
lulled into forgetfulness of the dismal present
by pictures of freedom and happiness. These
visions and prophecies, harmless enough in themselves,
derived a sad importance from the bitter and
savage animosity with which they inspired the
Roman governors. If the people, jealous of any
interference with their religion, looked upon the
slightest offense to it as an attack upon Judaism
itself, and made the governors, the emperor, and
the Roman state responsible for the delinquency,
the imperial officials in Judæa were not less susceptible,
for they treated the most trivial agitation
among the people as an insult to the majesty of
Rome and the emperor, and punished with equal
severity the innocent and the guilty. Vain was the
favor shown to the Judæan nation by the emperors
Claudius and Nero&mdash;the procurator constantly over-stepped
the limit of his authority, and urged on by
greed and the love of power, acted the part of
tyrant. Judæa had the misfortune to be almost
always governed by depraved creatures, who owed
their position to the reckless favorites who ruled
at court. They rivaled one another in acts of
wickedness and cruelty, thus ever increasing the
discontent and provoking the wrath of the people.
Cumanus, who succeeded Tiberius Alexander (about
48&ndash;52), was the first of five such avaricious and
bloodthirsty procurators. He governed only the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
provinces of Judæa and Samaria, Claudius having
bestowed the command of the province of Galilee
on Felix, the brother of his favorite, Pallas.
Cumanus and Felix became deadly foes.</p>

<p>It was the governor of Judæa who first excited
the resentment of the people. Jealous suspicion
of any great concourse of people assembled
in the Temple, a suspicion which, since the revolt
at the time of the census, had become traditional
among the Roman governors, induced Cumanus,
at the time of the Passover, to place an armed
cohort in the colonnade of the Temple to watch
the throngs which gathered there during that festival.
On that occasion a soldier, with the recklessness
often exhibited by the inferior Roman troops,
made an offensive gesture towards the sanctuary,
which the people interpreted as an insult to their
Temple. Carried away by indignation and anger,
they threw stones at the soldiers and abused
the governor. A tumult ensued, which threatened
to become a serious sedition. Cumanus ordered
fresh troops to advance and take possession of the
fortress of Antonia, and assuming a menacing
aspect, alarmed the people assembled round the
Temple, who now hastened to escape from his
reach. In their anxiety to get away, the crowds
pressed fearfully through the various places of exit,
and it is believed that more than ten or indeed
twenty thousand persons were suffocated or trampled
to death.</p>

<p>A similar occasion might have led to a like
disastrous result, had not Cumanus prudently
complied with the wishes of the people. On the
highway, not far from Bethoron, a band of Sicarii
having fallen upon and robbed a servant of the
emperor, Cumanus resolved that all the neighboring
villages should suffer bitterly for the act of violence
committed in their vicinity. One of the
Roman soldiers, infuriated by an attack upon a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
fellow-countryman, got possession of a Book of the
Law, tore it in pieces and threw the fragments into
the fire. Here was a new cause for angry excitement
and wrathful reproaches in the desecration of
what they held most sacred. Countless bands
flocked to Cumanus at Cæsarea, crying out against
the blasphemer. Much rather, they exclaimed,
would they suffer the worst fate themselves than
see their Holy Scriptures profaned; and in tones
of fury they called for the death of the guilty man.
The governor yielded this time to the counsel of
his friends, and ordered the soldier to be executed
in the presence of those whose religious feelings he
had outraged.</p>

<p>Another occurrence took a more serious form
and led to strife and bloodshed. Some Galilæans
who were on their way to a festival at Jerusalem,
passed through Samaria, and whilst in the town of
Ginæa, on the southeastern end of the plain of
Jezreel, they were murdered in a fray with the hostile
Samaritans. Was this only an accidental mischance,
or the result of the burning hatred which
existed between the Judæans and the Samaritans?
In either case the representatives of Galilee were
justified in demanding vengeance at the hands of
the governor upon the murderers. But Cumanus
treated the affair with contemptuous indifference,
and thus obliged the Judæans to deal with the
matter themselves. The leaders of the Zealots,
Eleazer ben Dinai and Alexander, incited both by
the Galilæans and their governor, Felix, took the
matter into their own hands, entered with their
troops the province of Acrabatene, inhabited by
Samaritans, and pitilessly destroyed and killed all
within their reach. The Samaritans appealed to
Cumanus for redress for this attack upon their
province, and he gave them permission to take up
arms, sending at the same time Roman troops to
assist them in a fearful massacre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
This proof, as they considered it, of the partisanship
of the emperor's officials roused the
anger of the inhabitants of Jerusalem to such a
degree that, spurred on among others by Dortus,
a man of some position, they were on the
point of attacking the troops of Cumanus, which
would doubtless have seriously increased the
gravity of the situation, and might have hastened
the final catastrophe by twenty years. The principal
inhabitants of Jerusalem, however, alarmed
at the possible consequences of an outbreak against
the Roman arms, strove to prevent so dangerous
an act, and, clothed in deep mourning, implored
the irritated multitude to pause and think of the
future. At their prayer the people laid down their
arms. But neither the Judæans nor the Samaritans
were really pacified, and still smarting under the
wrongs mutually received, they sent deputies to
the Syrian governor, Umidius Quadratus, accusing
each other, and asking him to investigate the
whole dispute. To effect that object, Quadratus
visited Samaria; but he was not an impartial judge,
and many of the captive Judæans were doomed to
perish on the cross. It was only after those executions
had taken place that he formed a tribunal of
justice, and summoned both parties to appear before
it. In the meantime, however, Felix having taken
the part of the Galilæans against the Samaritans,
such entanglements ensued that Quadratus would
not venture to adjudicate between the disputants, and
ordered them to send deputies to Rome to obtain
the decision of the emperor. Among the Judæan
envoys were Jonathan, the former high priest, and
Anan, the governor of the Temple. Cumanus was
also obliged to leave his post in order to appear at
Rome and justify himself there.</p>

<p>All the intricate court intrigues were brought into
play by this trial, which took on a more serious aspect
from the fact that the governor himself was one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
accused. The emperor caused a tribunal to be formed,
but the verdict was given not by himself, but by his
depraved wife, the notorious Agrippina, who was
the paramour of Pallas, the brother of Felix. It
had been arranged between the Judæan deputies
and Pallas that after sentence was pronounced
against Cumanus, the emperor should be asked
to name Felix governor of Judæa in his stead.
The verdict given in favor of the Judæans could
not be considered an impartial one, and was not
in itself a proof that the Samaritans had been
the aggressors. Many of them were pronounced
guilty and executed, and Cumanus was sent into
banishment. At the same time, probably also
through the intercession of the empress, a kingdom
in the northeast of Judæa was bestowed upon
Agrippa; it consisted of that part of the country
which had once belonged to Philip's tetrarchy,
Batanæa, Gaulanitis, Auranitis, Trachonitis, as well
as Paneas and Abilene. On Judæa proper Rome
kept a firm grasp, and would never allow a native
prince, however much he might be under Roman
influence and control, to exercise in that domain
any regal prerogatives.</p>

<p>Felix, whose appointment had been sought of the
emperor by the former high priest, Jonathan, succeeded
Cumanus as governor of Judæa. He
married Drusilla, King Agrippa II's beautiful sister,
who thereupon went over to paganism. During his
long administration, Felix surpassed all his predecessors
in arrogance and audacity. He gave himself
up entirely to the acquisition of riches and the
satisfaction of his appetites. He continued to
exercise his evil power even after the death of
Claudius (54). For although the young emperor,
Nero, or his mother, Agrippina, was as favorable to
the house of Herod as Claudius had been, and had
given Agrippa four considerable towns with their
surrounding districts as well as the important city<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
of Tiberias near Tarichea in Galilee, Judæa was
allowed to remain under the iron rule of its cruel
governor. Felix pretended to attack only the
seditious mutineers; but the fact of his consorting
with the wild Sicarii showed how little truth there
was in that assumption. Numerous, indeed, must
have been the victims who suffered death at his
hands under the plea that they were the enemies of
Rome, for even the former high priest, Jonathan, at
whose request the emperor had given Felix his
appointment, now bitterly reproached him for his
misdeeds. Exasperated by his boldness the governor
caused him to be assassinated, employing the
Sicarii to seize and murder him in the broad light
of day. Ishmael II, of the house of Phabi, was
named high priest by Agrippa in about the year 59.
It was during his pontificate that the family of the
high priest gained such power in the state that,
aided by a strong rabble, they were able to compel
the landowners to pay them all the tithes, thus
robbing the lower priests of their incomes and
causing many of them to perish from want.</p>

<p>The arrogance with which the governors treated
the nation was not without its baneful influence
upon the conduct of the foreigners who dwelt in
great numbers in the towns on the sea-coast. The
Greeks and Romans that had settled in Judæa
openly showed their hatred to their neighbors, and
usurped the position of masters in the land. The
fearful picture drawn by the great prophet seemed
now on the point of being literally fulfilled: "The
stranger in thy midst will ever rise higher, but
thou wilt ever sink lower." The most shameless in
their conduct towards the Judæans were the Greek
Syrians who lived in Cæsarea&mdash;even the civil rights
of the former were disputed by them. But the
Judæans of Cæsarea, who far surpassed their
heathen fellow-citizens in industry, wealth and
courage, would not allow themselves to be deprived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
of their rights of citizenship, and fierce disputes and
fights in the streets were consequently of almost
daily occurrence. On one occasion, some Judæan
youths having avenged with blows an insult they
had received from a party of Syrians, and obliged
the latter to flee, Felix took up the affair, called in
some troops, which, being chiefly composed of
Greeks and Syrians, sided heartily with their own
countrymen. Many Judæans lost their lives, many
were imprisoned, and the houses of the rich were
plundered and destroyed. The actual point in
dispute remained undecided, both sides being only
more embittered by the blood that had been shed.
The rival parties sent deputies to Rome, and Nero
was called upon to pronounce judgment between
them. Bribery gained the favor of Burrus, the
secretary of the emperor, to the cause of the
Syrians of Cæsarea. His verdict was consequently
given against the Judæans, who were deprived of
their civil rights.</p>

<p>Festus, the successor of Felix, governed for only
a short time (from 59 to 61). During that period
the unsatisfactory state of things remained unchanged,
or, if possible, became still worse. A new
enthusiast, proclaiming himself the Messiah, awoke
the hope of the people for liberty and redemption,
drew followers around him, and then shared the
fate of his predecessors. The jealous spite which
animated the different parties became more and
more violent. The king, Agrippa, at length took
up his residence in Jerusalem, in the Hasmonæan
palace, which was just opposite the Temple. In
order to overlook the courts of the latter he added
to the height of his palace, and from the hall in that
building, where he took his repasts, he could watch
every movement that took place in the Temple.
The Temple authorities took umbrage at this, and
complained that Agrippa encroached upon their
privileges; and in order to hide the Temple from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
his view they had a high wall built on its western
side. This aroused the displeasure of Agrippa and
of the governor, who wished to demolish the hardly
finished wall. Bitter words were used on both
sides; but at last prudence prevailed, and it was
resolved that the dispute should be settled by the
emperor. Twelve deputies, among whom were the
high priest Ishmael and the treasurer Hilkia, were
sent to represent the case at Rome. It was not
Nero, however, but his paramour, Poppea Sabina,
who gave the verdict. This beautiful but shameless
woman had, strangely enough, a preference for Judaism,
and as at Nero's court all state affairs were
conducted by intrigue, the Judæan deputies profited
by that happy chance and won their cause. The
deputies brought back the imperial order that the
jealous guard kept over the Temple should be discontinued.
A few years later Poppea interceded
again on behalf of two Judæans who had been condemned
by Felix and sent as prisoners to Rome. In
order not to infringe upon the laws of their religion
they, like Daniel and his friends, refused, whilst in
prison, to eat anything but fruit. But at the desire
of Poppea, who had now become empress, Nero
granted the self-denying captives their liberty.</p>

<p>After the death of Festus, Nero named Albinus
governor, and in comparison with those who preceded
and those who came after him he was looked
upon as a just ruler. Before he entered the province,
Anan the high priest attempted to revive the
half-extinct Sadducæism, and to put its penal code
again into force; a tribunal was elected by him, and
innocent men were condemned. The Pharisees
were so dissatisfied with this illegal Synhedrion that
they demanded of Agrippa the dismissal of the high
priest.</p>

<p>The new governor Albinus was met on his way
by accusations against Anan, who it was said had
infringed upon the authority of Rome by punishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
criminals himself. His enemies were successful,
and he was obliged to resign his office of high priest
after having filled it for three months. Joshua ben
Damnai succeeded him, but in a short time he had
to give way to Joshua ben Gamala (63 or 64).
Ben-Gamala had married a widow of great wealth,
Martha, a daughter of the house of the high priest
Boëthus, and it is said that she induced King
Agrippa II, by the offer of a large bribe, to confer
the office of high priest upon her husband. Between
Joshua ben Damnai and his more fortunate successor
there burned so fierce a hatred that their
respective followers could not meet in the streets
without insulting and even attacking each other.</p>

<p>Joshua ben Gamala can, however, by no means be
ranked among the worst of the high priests. The
improvement in education, which began with him,
testified to the interest he took in the useful institutions
of the community. He established schools for
boys from the age of five years in every town. But
Ben-Gamala did not long retain his high office; he
was obliged to resign it to Matthia ben Theophilus
(65), the last of the twenty-eight high priests who
owed their election to Rome and the house of Herod.
Albinus the governor, who was bent upon the destruction
of the fanatical Sicarii, embittered the
people by the heavy taxes laid upon them, a part of
which he kept for himself. Upon learning that a
successor had been appointed, he caused those of
the Sicarii who had been imprisoned for serious
offenses to be executed, and those who were suffering
for lighter misdeeds were, upon paying a fine,
set at liberty. The Sicarii thus released from imprisonment
took part afterwards in the insurrections
of the people against their oppressors, and
stained the good cause with many acts of cruelty.</p>

<p>The last of the procurators, Gessius Florus, who
also was appointed by Poppea, hastened by his
shameless partiality, avarice, and inhumanity, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
execution of the long-cherished plan of the malcontents
to shake off the tyrannical yoke of Rome.
Florus was one of those utterly profligate beings
to whom nothing is sacred; who sacrifice everything
to their greed, and disregard, without scruple,
the most solemn oaths. What his predecessors
had done with a pretense at least to some form, or
under the shadow of secrecy, he accomplished openly
in brazen-faced defiance of the Law. Inaccessible
to pity, he had indulgence only for the Sicarii,
who gave him a portion of their plunder. In the
two years during which his administration lasted
(64&ndash;66), many towns were completely sacked. The
Sicarii were allowed to carry on unmolested their
nefarious practices, the rich being obliged to purchase
their favor as well as that of their patrons.</p>

<p>So unbearable was this condition of the state that
even a cowardly nation must have lost patience, and
the courage of the Judæan people, in spite of the
thousand disasters which had befallen them, of the
heavy weight of the Roman yoke, and of the daily
acts of violence of which they were the victims, was
not yet broken. Rome at that time resembled a
community of madmen, among whom the emperor
Nero, confiding in the favor of the Senate and the
people, perpetrated one folly after another, and
was guilty of a succession of crimes. Thus, excepting
through their own endeavors, there appeared
no chance of deliverance for the Judæans.
This was the opinion of the best and greatest among
them, of all those who were not the tools of Rome,
or blinded by her false splendor, or paralyzed by
terror of her strength. The boldest were already
thinking of rebellion. The governor, Cestius Gallus,
had, in the meantime, been informed of the exasperation
and angry feeling that existed among the Judæan
people, and reported the state of Judæa at the
court of Rome, failing not to make known there
that the nation was brooding over conspiracy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
revolt. But no one listened to his warning voice.
Nero was too busy to attend to such trifles; he had
to play the zither, to perform on the stage, to indulge
in orgies, and to devise murders. The Empress
Poppea, the friend of the Judæans, was dead. The
creatures of the court resembled the monster Gessius
Florus, and doubtless derided what they considered
the puerile fears of Gallus. The latter
thereupon devised a plan to bring prominently
before Nero's court the vastness of the population
of Judæa, and the imprudence of underrating it. It
was arranged between Agrippa and the high priest
Matthia that at the Feast of the Passover a great
though peaceful demonstration should take place,
through a peculiar manner of numbering the people.
Circulars were sent to the community, residing both
within and outside Judæa, bidding vast numbers
appear at the coming festival. Crowds of worshipers,
a greater concourse than had ever assembled
before, obeyed the summons. In the spring of the
year 66 they flocked to celebrate the Feast of Passover;
from the towns and villages of Judæa, from
Syria, even from countries bordering the Euphrates,
and from Egypt, they streamed into Jerusalem, which
could hardly contain the vast multitude. On their
way towards the Temple, some of the pilgrims were
crushed in the crowd, and this feast was thereafter
called the Passover of the Crushing. The numbering
of the people was carried on in the following
way:&mdash;From each offering a kidney was taken for
the priests, the kidneys thus appropriated being
counted; and it was reckoned that each lamb that
was eaten in company, was partaken of by at least
ten persons. The result of these calculations
proved that nearly three millions were at that time
present in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Cestius Gallus had himself come to Jerusalem to
conduct the investigation, and all appealed to him
to have pity on their unspeakable woes, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
deliver them from their country's scourge. Florus,
who was present, only smiled, but the governor of
the city promised to use his influence in softening
the procurator's heart towards them, and he acquainted
Rome with the imposing concourse he had
seen with his own eyes at Jerusalem. He was,
however, much deceived as to the effect produced by
his device of proving how great were the numbers
of the people. Nero, at that time, had reached the
highest point of his arrogance and pride. "Should
Nero, whose triumphs surpassed those of Pompey,
Cæsar, and Augustus, fear Judæa?" The account
sent by Cestius Gallus of the crowds assembled at
Jerusalem during the Feast of Passover was probably
not even read by Nero, or, if looked at, only
thrown to the winds.</p>

<p>In Judæa, and above all in the capital, men,
young and old, became daily more impatient to
break the galling chains of Rome. Patience was
exhausted; they awaited only the favorable moment
when they could strike at their foe with a chance of
success. A trifling incident, which brought to light
the unparalleled insolence of Florus, fanned the
spirit of impatience and closed the lips of prudence.
Fresh causes of disagreement had arisen between
the Judæans and the Syrians in Cæsarea; the former
could not forget that Nero had lowered them in
the eyes of their fellow-citizens, and the latter,
elated by the preference given them, made the
Judæans feel their degraded position. The irritation
thus caused, stirred up the religious hatred and
racial animosity which slumbered under the surface
in both communities. A piece of ground belonging
to a heathen in Cæsarea, which happened to be
just in front of the synagogue, was covered by him
with shops, so that only one narrow entrance to the
sacred building remained. The hot-headed Judæan
youths tried to interrupt the construction of these
booths, and Florus, won over by a large sum of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
money, refrained from interfering; and, in order not
to be a witness of the probable scene of contention,
he absented himself and went to Samaria, leaving
the two bitterly-opposed parties to the undisturbed
exercise of their passionate animosity. On a certain
Sabbath, while the Judæans were assembled in worship,
a Greek placed a vessel in front of the synagogue
and sacrificed birds upon it, to signify that
the Judæans were descendants of outcast lepers.
This calumny concerning the origin of their race was
not taken quietly by the Judæan youths, who
instantly armed themselves and fell upon their
mocking foes. The fight ended in the defeat of the
Judæans, all of whom thereupon, carrying away their
holy books, betook themselves to the neighboring
small town of Narbata, and thence sent an embassy
of twelve men, among whom was the rich
tax-gatherer Jonathan, to Florus in Samaria. The
deputies reminded him of the sum he had received,
and of his promise to afford them protection. But
instead of listening to their supplications he received
them harshly, and threw them into prison. When
tidings of this new act of violence reached Jerusalem,
the anger of the whole population was aroused, but
before they had time to form any plan of action, Florus
sent them another exasperating message. He
desired the warden of the Temple to hand over out
of the sacred treasury seventeen talents, which he
declared were required in the service of the emperor.
This command, the intention of which was plainly
discerned by the inhabitants of Jerusalem, made
them flock around the Temple as though they would
shield the threatened Sanctuary. The timid broke
forth in lamentations, and the fearless reviled the
Roman governor, and carried a box about as though
they were collecting alms for the indigent Florus.
The latter, anticipating opportunities to satisfy his
avarice and thirst for blood, now came himself to
Jerusalem, and by his presence added fuel to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
fire. Florus placed himself as judge in front of
the palace of Herod, and called upon the high
priest and the men of greatest standing to appear
before him, demanding them to deliver into his
hands those who had dared mock him. Trembling,
they endeavored to offer excuses for what
had taken place, and implored his mercy. But
Florus heeded them not, and gave orders to the
Roman soldiers to plunder the upper market-place,
a quarter inhabited by the wealthy. Like very demons
the wild soldiers threw themselves into the
market and the adjoining streets, killed men, women
and children, ransacked houses and carried off their
contents. On that one day (16th Iyar), more than
three thousand six hundred men perished. The
prisoners, by the command of Florus, were scourged
and crucified. In vain had the princess or queen
Berenice knelt before Florus, imploring him to stay
the work of bloodshed and destruction; he was deaf
to her entreaties, and in fear for her own safety she
was obliged to seek refuge and safety in her palace.</p>

<p>Some days after, vast crowds gathered in the now
half-ruined upper town (Zion), uttering lamentations
for those who had been killed and pronouncing
execrations upon their murderer Florus, and it was
not without much difficulty that the heads of the
people succeeded in silencing them. But this only
increased the audacity of Florus, who demanded, as
a proof of their present peaceable intentions, that
the people with the nobles should go forth to meet
the incoming troops and welcome them in a friendly
spirit. The representatives of the Sanctuary could
hardly induce the people to comply with that request,
for the patriots rebelled against the new humiliation
thus thrust upon them, and persuaded many to share
their sentiments. At length, however, the high
priest succeeded in persuading the people to offer
an amicable reception to the Roman cohorts. But
soon the deceitful intention of the governor manifested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
itself. The people fulfilled the heavy sacrifice
they had with heavy hearts undertaken to perform,
and greeted the troops with forced friendliness; but
the soldiers, having received their instructions from
Florus, looked grimly at them and made no response.
At the first murmur of discontent caused
by the strange manner of the Roman troops, the
latter rushed upon the people with drawn swords,
driving them before them, whilst the horses trampled
on the fugitives. A fearful crush took place at the
gates of the city, and the road from Bezetha was
strewn with the wounded and the killed. When it
was perceived that the soldiers were directing their
steps towards Fort Antonia and the Temple, the
designs of Florus upon the treasures contained
in it could no longer be concealed, and the people
hastened to the Sanctuary to protect it, if possible,
from his sacrilegious project. They threw stones
at the soldiers, barred their passage through the
narrow entrance, demolished the colonnade which
connected the fortress Antonia with the Temple,
and thus frustrated the governor's hope of becoming
a second Crassus. Without being aware of it themselves,
the inhabitants of Jerusalem had by that step
commenced the war of insurrection.</p>

<p>Before the determined attitude of the people the
courage of Florus forsook him. He informed the
representatives of the capital that in order to restore
peace to Jerusalem, he would quit the city and withdraw
the greater number of the troops, leaving only
a small garrison behind. Upon representations
being made to him that the greater part of the army
was hated by the people, on account of the inhumanity
of which it had been guilty, he bade them
choose those soldiers who had taken least part in
the recent butchery. The representatives of Judæa
selected the soldiers who served under Metilius,
whose weak disposition appeared to them a pledge
of forbearance. But hardly had Florus left Jerusalem,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
when the heated ferment resolved itself into
determined action. The people were divided into
two parties, one was the party of peace, the other
the party that favored revolution. The latter party
was composed chiefly of the young and strong, who
shared the views and principles of the Zealots.
They were ready to risk their lives in their endeavor
to overthrow the yoke of pagan, tyrannical Rome,
and regain their cherished liberty.</p>

<p>The revolutionary party was not devoid of statesmanlike
discretion; it had already formed an alliance
with the princely house of Adiabene, which
was warmly devoted to Judaism, and had likewise
managed to interest the Parthian-Babylonian community
in its cause. The advocates of war, bold
and fearless, looked down upon their more timid
brethren. Men of strength, filled with lofty aspirations,
they swore a solemn oath to die rather
than submit to Rome; and well did they keep that
oath in the raging war, under the hail of the catapults,
tortured by the rack, and in the arena of
wild beasts. The soul of the revolutionary party in
Jerusalem was Eleazar ben Ananias, who belonged
to a high-priestly family. He was well versed in the
Law, and belonged to the strict school of Shammai,
which generally agreed with the Zealots.</p>

<p>On the side of peace were the followers of
Hillel, who abhorred war on principle; the nobles
who were basking in the brilliant sunshine of
Rome; the wealthy, whose possessions would be
exposed to jeopardy through so great a revolution&mdash;all
these, though smarting under the insolence
of Florus, desired the continuance of the present
state of things under the imperial power of
Rome. The honest friends of peace, however,
failed to perceive that the evil from which the Judæan
community suffered did not depend upon
any one person who might be accidentally in power,
but upon the system of tutelage and robbery, and on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
the fundamental difference which existed between
the foreign rulers and the people they governed.
Even the best governors, those who truly desired
to preserve order and peace, could not have prevented
the susceptibility of the nation from being
frequently wounded, nor the constant irritation of
the people.</p>

<p>The people, although aroused and embittered,
appeared undecided, and paused before taking
the final step, each party trying to draw the populace
to its side. The friends of peace, whilst they
strove to moderate the anger of the masses, endeavored
likewise to justify their revolt against Florus
before the Syrian governor, Cestius, and to explain
that Florus was in fault for the disturbance which
had broken out. They acquainted Cestius with
everything that had occurred, and begged him to
come to Jerusalem to see with his own eyes the
misery and ruin caused by the acts of the last governor,
and to convince himself of the friendly demeanor
of its inhabitants. Cestius, too indolent to
come and inquire into the matter himself, sent a
deputy, Neapolitanus, in his stead.</p>

<p>The leaders of the revolutionary party had, in
the meantime, been so successful that the payment
of taxes to Rome was withheld. The king, Agrippa,
who, from motives of self-interest, was in favor of
peace, called the people together, and attempted
to open their eyes to the danger into which they
were blindly running. Standing upon a high gallery
opposite the Temple he spoke to the people. At
his side was the Princess Berenice, who had interceded
for the injured and downtrodden, to cover
him with the shield of her popularity.</p>

<p>His speech, containing every argument that
reason or sophistry could urge against war with
Rome, made at first some impression upon the
people. A great number of them cried out that
they had no ill-will against the Romans, but only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
desired to be delivered from the yoke of Florus.
Thereupon Agrippa exhorted the assembled multitude
to show that they were really peacefully
inclined by replacing the broken columns they
had thrown down and paying the taxes due
to the emperor. For the moment it appeared as
though their angry feelings were about to subside.
The shattered colonnade was to be repaired, and
in the adjoining towns and villages taxes were
gathered. When Agrippa found what an advantage
he had gained he went a step further, and tried
to persuade the people to obey Florus as their
governor until his successor should be appointed.
But this last demand spoilt all. The revolutionary
party again won the upper hand, and Agrippa
was obliged to flee from Jerusalem. Those who
had so often suffered from the cruelty and injustice
of Florus, at the very mention of his name feared
to become again his miserable dupes and the
victims of cunning intrigue. After Agrippa's departure
there was no question of taxes. Universal
was the satisfaction at their abolition, and the tax-gatherers
durst not confront the prevailing excitement
by attempting to enforce their payment.
The day on which it was resolved not to pay the
taxes, the 25th Sivan (June), was henceforth to
be kept as the anniversary of a victory. The
Sicarii now also began to bestir themselves.
They assembled under the command of Menahem,
a descendant of Judas, the founder of the Zealots,
and took the fortress of Masada; they put its
Roman garrison to death, possessed themselves of
their weapons, and being thus well armed, appeared
on the field of battle.</p>

<p>Eleazar, the head of the Zealots, fanned the
revolutionary spirit of the people, and drove them
on to complete rupture with Rome. He dissuaded
the priests from receiving any presents or
sacrifices from heathens, and so great was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
power he exerted that the officiating priests discontinued
offering the daily sacrifice for the emperor
Nero. That was the starting-point of the revolution.
Allegiance to the emperor was thenceforth
renounced. The party of peace saw also the grave
importance of this step and tried to retrace it.
Learned teachers of the Law, doubtless of the
school of Hillel, explained to a large gathering of
the people that it was unlawful to shut out the
offerings of heathens from the Temple, and aged
priests declared that it was an ancient custom to
receive such offerings. The officiating priests,
however, remained unconvinced, and threw themselves
without reserve into the maelstrom of revolution.
From that time on, the Temple obeyed its
chief, Eleazar, and became the hotbed of the insurrection.</p>

<p>The advocates of peace saw with sorrow the progress
made by the rival party, and tried to smother
the flames before they could accomplish the
work of destruction and ruin; but the means they
employed to quench the revolutionary fire only made
it burn the more fiercely. They sent deputies to
Florus and Agrippa, earnestly entreating that a sufficiently
large number of troops should be instantly
despatched to Jerusalem. The former, actuated
either by timidity or by the spirit of revenge which
made him desire that the hated Judæans should become
more and more hopelessly entangled, refused
to comply with that request. Agrippa, on the other
hand, sent 3,000 horsemen, Auranites, Batanæans,
and wild Trachonites, under the command of Philip
of Bathyrene, and Darius, a commander of cavalry,
to help the party that wished to remain at peace
with Rome. When these troops arrived, they found
the Mount on which the Temple stood, as well as
the lower town, already in the possession of the
Zealots. The aristocratic quarter of the higher
town alone remained open to them. A fierce combat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
took place between the two parties, the royal
troops joining the few soldiers left of the Roman
garrison. Fighting continued for seven days, with
no decided results.</p>

<p>At the time of the festival of wood-carrying (15th
Ab), however, the situation changed. The Zealots
barred the entrance of the Temple against any one
belonging to the peace party, and gained over to
their side the masses who had brought wood for the
altar, as well as the Sicarii who had made their way
into the Temple through the crowd. Strengthened
by the increase of numbers, the Zealots drove away
their opponents and became masters of the upper
town. The anger of the people was roused against
the friends of Rome, they set fire to the palaces of
King Agrippa and Princess Berenice, devoting to
the flames likewise the house of the rich priest
Ananias, and the public archives, among which the
bonds of debtors were kept. Some of the partisans
of Rome crept in terror into the sewers, while others
took refuge with the troops in the western palace of
Herod. Shortly after this the Zealots attacked the
Roman guards in the fort Antonia, overcame them
after a siege of two days, and put them to death
(17th Ab); they then stormed the palace of Herod,
which was defended by the combined troops of
Rome and Agrippa. After eighteen days of incessant
fighting the garrison capitulated and the Judæan
soldiers under Philip were allowed to depart
unhurt. The Romans, too proud to sue for mercy,
retreated to the three towers in the wall, Hippicus,
Phasael, and Mariamne. The Sicarii under Menahem
rushed into the fort after the Romans had left
it, and killed all who had not been able to save themselves
by flight (6th Elul&mdash;August).</p>

<p>But the patriotic Zealots, the followers of Eleazar,
were soon made aware of the injury their righteous
cause must sustain from their fraternizing with the
unrestrainable Sicarii. Puffed up by their victory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
over Agrippa's troops, Menahem and his satellites
broke out into acts of shameful cruelty. Insulting
pride now characterized Menahem's behavior;
words of anger were exchanged between him and
Eleazar; and as the former entered the Temple in
the captured regal attire, the words became blows
and fighting commenced. The Sicarii were besieged,
and Menahem, who had fled to the part of the city
called Ophla, was brought back and executed. A
small number of his followers, under his relative
Eleazar ben Jair, escaped to the fortress of Masada,
which was occupied by their friends. After this
bloody episode the Zealots, led by Eleazar, besieged
the towers, and the Roman troops under the command
of Metilius were at last obliged to sue for
mercy. The Judæans deputed to treat with Metilius
agreed that the Romans, deprived of their arms and
baggage, should be allowed to depart unmolested.
As soon, however, as the conquered soldiers were
divested of their swords and shields, Eleazar's band
fell upon them and destroyed them all. Metilius
alone was spared, because in the fear of death he
had promised to adopt the Judæan faith, and he was
allowed to live an animated trophy of the victory
of the Judæans over the Romans. The day on
which Jerusalem was delivered from the Romans
(17 Elul) was henceforth to be considered one of the
festive anniversaries. That the aim of Eleazar and
his party was noble and disinterested was shown by
the moderation they observed after their victory.
The city was in their hands, their rivals helpless,
and yet in the annals of those times we can discover
no trace of persecution or cruelty towards them.</p>

<p>Thus far the insurrection had been limited to
Jerusalem, for the rest of Judæa, although equally
excited, remained quiet during the events that were
taking place in the capital, and awaited the result.
Florus himself had likewise remained quietly at
Cæsarea, taking care, however, that the revolution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
should flow on like a stream of fire, carrying devastation
all over the country, and even beyond its
boundaries. When tidings of the battle between
the Zealots and the Roman cohorts in Jerusalem
reached Cæsarea, the Greeks and Syrians attacked
the Judæans who had returned there. The carnage
which ensued must have been fearful; more than
twenty thousand Judæans were killed, and these,
doubtless, did not succumb without, in self-defense,
causing some other deaths. Not a single Judæan
remained alive in Cæsarea. Those who tried to
flee were captured, put into chains by the command
of Florus, and sent as slaves to various ships.
This unexampled cruelty exasperated the whole
population of Judæa, and their hatred against the
heathens broke out into wild frenzy. Everywhere,
as though by common assent, bands of free troops
formed themselves, attacking the heathen inhabitants
of the country, burning, destroying, and slaying.
These barbarous onslaughts, of course, called
again for revenge from the heathen population of
Judæa and Syria. Many towns were divided into
two hostile parties, which savagely fought together
during the day, and lay in ambush to injure each
other at night.</p>

<p>A horrible deed, resulting from the war of races,
took place in the town of Bethshean, the first of
a long series of acts of self-destruction of which
we read in the account of the destruction of the
Temple. Its heathen inhabitants had made a
covenant with their Judæan fellow-citizens, promising
to befriend them if they would assist in
repulsing any attack of Judæan bands upon their
town. The Judæans in Bethshean honestly fulfilled
their agreement, fought vigorously against their
brethren, and drove them away from the vicinity of
the town. Among the combatants on that occasion,
Simon ben Saul, a Judæan of gigantic strength
and great valor, was principally distinguished.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
No sooner, however, were the heathen inhabitants
delivered from their assailants than, under cover of
the night, they fell upon the unguarded Judæans,
and put them all, nearly thirteen thousand, to death.
In that fearful massacre Simon and his family
alone survived, the former, wielding his drawn
sword with the energy of despair, drove terror into
the hearts of his enemies. Full of anguish and
remorse at having fought against his brethren, he
resolved to fall only by his own hand. After
killing his aged parents, his wife and children, he
thrust his sword into his breast and expired at
their side.</p>

<p>The violent animosity which inflamed the Judæans
and heathens in Cæsarea also reached Alexandria.
A massacre of the Judæans, partly due to
the anger of an apostate, took place in the Egyptian
capital. The Alexandrian Greeks, jealous of
their Judæan fellow-citizens, resolved to solicit the
Emperor Nero to deprive them of the rights which
they had received from Claudius, putting them on
a footing of equality with the Greeks. To select
the deputies who were to convey their wishes to
the emperor, a large concourse assembled in the
amphitheater of the town. A few Judæans being
discovered among the crowd, they were fiercely
attacked and insulted as spies. Three of them were
dragged through the streets to be committed alive
to the flames. Enraged at the savage treatment
of their brethren, the Judæans armed themselves,
seized firebrands, and threatened to burn the
amphitheater where the Greeks were still assembled.
The governor Tiberius now attempted to interfere
in order to stay the impending civil strife, but
he only increased the angry ferment. The Judæans
hated him for being a renegade to his faith,
and reproached him with his apostasy. Infuriated
by their taunts, Tiberius Alexander lost all control
over himself; he ordered his legions to repair to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
the Judæan quarter, and gave free license to the
exercise of that brutality which it had cost so
much effort to restrain. The soldiers, greedy for
blood and plunder, poured in upon the beautiful
Delta quarter of the town, killed all whom they found
in their way, burned the houses, and filled the streets
with blood and corpses. Fifty thousand Judæans lost
their lives, and the man who ordered that frightful
butchery was the nephew of the Judæan philosopher
Philo!</p>

<p>Such was the alarming proportion which the
insurrectionary movement by Eleazar ben Ananias
had assumed. The revolution had tasted
blood, and was drawn on and on in its hurried
course till it carried away even the indifferent, and
converted almost the whole nation into Zealots.
From day to day the number of brave and daring
warriors increased. The expected help now came
from Adiabene and Babylon. Members of the
royal house of Adiabene, brothers and sons of the
King Izates, Monobazus and Cenedæus, took the
management of the rebellion into their own hands,
and prepared to hold out to the last. Three
heroes, who alone seemed more than equal to a
whole army, now entered Jerusalem. They were
Niger, from the other side of the Jordan, Silas, the
Babylonian, and Simon Bar-Giora, the wild patriot,
who, from his first entrance to the end of the war,
brought terror to the hearts of the Romans.
Cestius Gallus, whose duty it was as Governor of
Syria to uphold the honor of Roman arms, and to
keep the imperial supremacy intact in the country
placed under his jurisdiction, could no longer
witness the rebellion spreading around him without
an effort to stem its progress. He called his
legions together, and the neighboring princes voluntarily
sent their troops to his assistance as auxiliaries.
Even Agrippa contributed three thousand
foot soldiers and two thousand horsemen to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
Roman army, and offered himself as guide through
the mountain paths and ravines of that dangerous
country. Cestius led more than thirty thousand
men, experienced soldiers, out of Antioch, against
Judæa, and doubted not that in one battle he would
be able to destroy the Judæan rebels. On his way
along the sea-coast he left in every town marks of
blood and fire.</p>

<p>As soon as the Zealots in Jerusalem heard of the
approach of the Roman troops they seized their
arms, in spite of its being the Sabbath day. They
were not afraid to face the Romans, nor would they
allow the Sabbath laws to interfere with their warlike
ardor. Cestius had made a halt at Gabaot,
about a mile from Jerusalem, expecting, perhaps, a
missive of repentant submission. But the Zealots
attacked the Roman army with such impetuosity
that they broke through their ranks, killing in the
first onslaught more than five hundred soldiers,
whilst they only lost three and twenty men themselves
(26th Tishri&mdash;October). If the Roman cavalry
had not come to the assistance of the foot
soldiers, the latter would have been utterly destroyed.
Loaded with rich booty, the victors returned to Jerusalem,
singing jubilant hosannas, while Cestius during
three days remained idle in his camp without
venturing to advance.</p>

<p>It was only on the fourth day that the Roman
army approached the capital. The Zealots had
abandoned the outer parts of Jerusalem, which could
afford them no adequate shelter, and had withdrawn
behind the strong walls of the inner town behind
the Temple. The Romans thereupon marched in,
destroyed the suburb Bezetha, then pressed on
towards the western point, just opposite Herod's
palace, where they pitched their camp (30th Tishri).
This caused no alarm to the Zealots; they threw
the traitors who, following the advice of Anan ben
Jonathan, wished to open the gates to the enemy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
over the walls, and prepared vigorously for the
defense of the places they occupied. During five
successive days the Romans stormed the walls, but
were always obliged to fall back before the missiles
of the Judæans. It was only on the sixth day that
they succeeded in undermining a part of the northern
wall in front of the Temple. But this advantage
was not followed up by Cestius. He did not deem
it advisable to continue the combat against heroic
enthusiasts and embark on a lengthy campaign at
that season, when the autumn rains would soon commence,
if they had not already set in, and might
prevent the army from receiving provisions. On
that account probably he thought it more prudent
to retrace his steps. It could hardly have been
cowardice which inspired the resolve.</p>

<p>As soon as the unexpected departure of the Romans
became known to the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
they followed them, attacking the rear and flanks of
the army from the mountain crests, the Roman troops
being obliged to keep to the beaten ways in the valleys
and passes. A great number of Romans, among
whom were many distinguished officers, lay slain
upon the line of march. When the army reached
the camp in Gabaot, it found itself surrounded by
swarming hosts of Judæans, and Cestius, not considering
it safe to remain there any longer, hastened
his retreat, leaving the heaviest part of the baggage
behind. In the narrow pass of Bethoron the Roman
army fared still worse; attacked on all sides, it was
brought into confusion and disorder, and the men
could not defend themselves from the arrows of the
enemy, which fell thick upon them from the vantage-ground
of the mountain wall on either side. Wildly
the Roman troops hurried on towards Bethoron,
and they would have been almost completely destroyed
in their flight had not approaching night
saved them from further pursuit.</p>

<p>The Judæans remained all night before Bethoron,
but Cestius, leaving four hundred brave soldiers in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
the camp, marched noiselessly out with the whole
of his army, so that at break of day, when the
Judæans perceived what had taken place, he had
already obtained a considerable start. The four
hundred soldiers left behind succumbed to the
Judæans, who then vainly followed the Roman army
as far as Antipatris. They found, however, rich
booty, consisting of arms and implements of war.
These they brought back as trophies to Jerusalem,
making good use of them later on against their
enemies. The money chests of Cestius, which contained
the supplies for the war, fell also into their
hands, and helped to replenish the treasury at Jerusalem.
In this first campaign against the despised
Judæans the army of Cestius lost nearly six thousand
men, both Romans and allies; and the legion
which the governor had brought from Antioch as a
picked corps to fight against Jerusalem had lost
their eagles, a loss which was regarded by Rome as
the greatest dishonor that could befall an army,
equivalent to a shameful defeat.</p>

<p>The Zealots, shouting exultant war songs, returned
to Jerusalem (8th October), their hearts beating
with the joyful hope of liberty and independence.
The proud and happy time of the Hasmonæans
seemed to have returned, and its glory even to be
surpassed. Had not the great Roman army, feared
by all the world, been defeated and forced to ignominious
flight? What a change had been effected
in the brief space of six months! Then every one
trembled before the cowardly Florus and his few soldiers,
and now the Romans had fled! Had not God
helped them as mercifully as He had helped their
forefathers? The hearts of the Zealots knew no
fears for the future. "As we have beaten the two
generals, Metilius and Cestius, so likewise shall we
overcome their successors." Any one who spoke
of submission to Rome or of the advantage of opening
negotiations with her was looked upon as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
traitor to his country and an enemy to Judaism.
The advocates of peace had for the moment lost all
influence, and the friends of Rome could not venture
to utter aloud their real sentiments. Many of
them left Jerusalem secretly, whilst others pretended
to share the Zealots' love of freedom and hatred of
Rome. The two Herodian brothers, Costobar and
Saul, sought the presence of the Emperor Nero in
Greece, attempting to excuse the insurrectionary
outburst and to throw the blame of it upon Florus.
While they were trying to vindicate the fidelity of
the Judæan nation, the Zealots, intoxicated with
their victory, had coins struck with the inscription&mdash;"For
the deliverance of Jerusalem." Even the
Samaritans now put aside their old feeling of animosity
against the Judæans, and to gratify their
hatred of the Romans made common cause with
their former enemies.</p>

<p>Stirring activity took possession of the capital,
and gave it quite a new appearance. Everywhere
weapons were being forged and implements of war
manufactured, in preparation for any fresh assault.
The walls of Jerusalem were strengthened to a degree
that promised to set the enemy for a long time
at defiance. The young men underwent daily military
exercise, and their enthusiasm made up for their
want of experience. In all parts of Judæa the warlike
patriots and foes of Rome formed provisional
committees to prepare for the great struggle which
they felt must be approaching, and their glowing
ardor was shared even by the Judæans who lived
in foreign lands.</p>

<p>Of the internal political arrangements introduced
in Jerusalem after the defeat of Cestius, only slight
and uncertain indications have come down to us.
The historian friendly to Rome, who could not sufficiently
darken the rebellion of the Judæans, was not
inclined to record any of their acts. There can be
no doubt, however, that the Great Synhedrion again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
acquired its former supreme authority over all political
and military affairs. At the head of the great
council was Simon ben Gamaliel, of the House of
Hillel, one who, even according to the account of his
enemy, must have been gifted with remarkable discernment
and energy, and who might, had his advice
been followed, have brought the impending struggle
to a successful issue. Although he did not belong
to the party of extreme Zealots, he desired the contest
to be carried on with the most resolute activity,
and upheld, with all the strength given him by his
eminence and position, those who were determined
that the revolution should be real and its effects lasting.
Upon coins dating from the first and second
years of the newly-won independence, appears the
following inscription, "Simon, the Prince of Israel,"
which doubtless referred to the Patriarch Simon ben
Gamaliel.</p>

<p>After the victory gained over Cestius, the
heathens became more and more embittered against
their Judæan neighbors; and either from fear of
an onslaught from them, or actuated by revenge
for the defeat of the Romans, they formed themselves
into murderous bands, slaying without pity
Judæan men, women and children who were living
among them. Such cruel massacres must have
incensed the patriots all the more, as they frequently
occurred among communities innocent of
the remotest idea of joining the rebellion, and now,
as far as lay in their power, the Judæans took
their revenge upon their heathen neighbors. The
savage enmity of races rose higher and higher, and,
spreading far beyond the narrow boundary of Palestine,
animated the Judæans on the one side and
the Greeks and Romans on the other. As all the
nations around Judæa, including Syrians, Greeks,
Romans and Alexandrians, made common cause
with the Roman emperor, the ultra-Zealots thought
themselves justified in visiting upon them the wrath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
that inflamed them against Rome. To cut off
every link between them, the followers of the school
of Shammai proposed erecting a barrier which
should effectually prevent any communication, by
prohibiting the Judæans in future from buying
wine, oil, bread, or any other articles of food from
their heathen neighbors. These regulations were
known under the name of "The Eighteen Things."
Religious fervor and political zealotry, in those
stormy times, always accompanied each other.
The Hillelites, more moderate in their religious and
political views, could not agree to such sharply defined
exclusiveness, but when the Synod was called
together to decide upon the laws before mentioned,
the Zealots proved all-powerful. Eleazar ben
Ananias, probably the leader of the Zealots, who
was himself a teacher of the Law, invited the disciples
of both schools to meet in his house. Armed
soldiers were placed at the door and were directed
to allow every one to enter but no one to go out,
and during the fiery discussions that were carried
on there, many of the school of Hillel are said to
have been killed. On account of these acts of
violence, the day on which the severe decrees of
the school of Shammai were brought forward and
agreed to, the 9th Adar, was regarded as a day of
misfortune.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the warlike activity of the Judæans
had not ceased for a moment. The urgent necessity
of making a selection of generals and leaders
for the approaching strife was felt by all. The
important choice belonged, it appears, to the people
themselves, who for some cause or other had taken
umbrage at the ultra-Zealots. Eleazar ben Ananias,
who had given the first impulse to the great uprising,
was only made governor of the unimportant
province of Idumæa, and was even obliged to divide
his authority with another.</p>

<p>Eleazar ben Simon, an ultra-Zealot, who had
been instrumental in gaining the victory over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
Cestius and who was the treasurer of the Temple,
was, in spite of belonging to the class of nobles,
completely overlooked. Moderate men, even those
who had been formerly friends of Rome, obtained the
preference. Joseph ben Gorion, and Anan the son
of Anan, who for a short time had held the office of
high priest, received posts of the greatest importance,
the supervision of Jerusalem and the defense
of the fortresses. Besides these, five governors were
appointed over different provinces. To Joseph ben
Matthias was entrusted the most important place of
all. The people, still dazzled by the magic of
aristocratic names, could not allow men of unknown
origin, however brave and devoted they
might be, to fill high political positions. The
ruling power lay in the Great Synhedrion, and consequently
in those who presided over that assembly,
Simon ben Gamaliel and his associates Anan and
Joseph ben Gorion.</p>

<p>Simon was at the head of the Pharisees, and
Anan, the former high priest, made no attempt to
conceal his leaning towards Sadducæism; but their
antagonism in religious matters did not prevent
them from now acting together. The love of
country outweighed the spirit of partisanship. The
apparent unanimity that reigned in the Synhedrion
was nevertheless deceptive. Great nobles, secret
friends to Rome, had a place and voice in that
assembly, and often brought indecision into its
councils. Opposite and conflicting views resulted
in halting measures and diminished vigor. The
Synhedrion was likewise often swayed by the
changing sentiments of the people, which always
receive attention in the hour of revolution. Thus
deprived of united strength and active energy, the
Synhedrion ruled for barely two years, when it succumbed
through weakness, and was obliged to give
up the reins to the ultra-Zealots.</p>

<p class="center bpad">66&ndash;67 <span class="smcap smaller">C.&nbsp;E.</span></p>

<p>The territory entrusted for defense to Joseph ben
Matthias, by reason of its position, its astonishing
fertility, its sturdy population, and its various resources
in time of danger, was looked upon as the
post of greatest importance next to the capital; it
was, in fact, the bulwark of Jerusalem. Galilee was
divided into Upper and Lower Galilee. This, the
country of enthusiasts, the birthplace of the Zealot
Judas and of Jesus of Nazareth, did not receive the
news of the revolt of Jerusalem and the defeat of
Cestius with indifference. It assumed, on the contrary,
with unreflecting ardor the jubilant spirit of
the victorious party. And how could the Galilæans
have remained indifferent? Had they not witnessed
the cruel deaths of their own kin at the hands of the
heathen? Daily they had been in the habit of giving
shelter to unhappy Judæan exiles, and daily they
had had to fear the worst from their heathen neighbors.
It was in the face of such dangers that all the
cities of Galilee had armed to be ready for action,
and were only awaiting a signal from the Synhedrion
in Jerusalem. Three cities above all others were
longing to raise the standard of revolt&mdash;Gischala
in the extreme north, Tiberias in the south, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
Gamala, opposite Tiberias, on the eastern shores of
the Sea of Galilee. The Judæan inhabitants of
Gischala were, to a certain extent, forced into insurrection,
for the neighboring cities had banded
together, and, after plundering the town, had partly
destroyed it by fire. The enraged Gischalites placed
themselves under the leadership of a man destined
to carry on the war against Rome to its bitter end,
and who, in company with Simon bar-Giora, became
the terror of her legions.</p>

<p>John ben Levi, of Gischala, commenced his career
by collecting under his flag all the rebellious Judæans
of Upper Galilee, and by preparing to lead
them against the heathen populace. He was a man
of small means and of delicate constitution, but he
possessed one of those enthusiastic natures capable
of rising above the depressing influences of poverty
and ill-health; besides which he had the art of
making the circumstances of his life subservient to
his own aims. At the commencement of the Galilæan
rising, John's only ambition was to strengthen
the walls of his birthplace against the attacks of
hostile neighbors. Later on, he expended the considerable
sums of money which he earned by selling
oil to the Judæans of Syria and Cæsarea Philippi
(for they would not use the unclean oil prepared by
the heathens), in paying for the services of patriotic
volunteers. He had gathered around him about
four thousand of these, principally Galilæans, but
partly refugees from Syria, who were always increasing
in number.</p>

<p>In Tiberias, the second focus of insurrection, the
revolutionary party were confronted by a faction
with Roman proclivities. This beautiful city by the
sea had been in the possession of King Agrippa
for many years, and having enjoyed a tolerably
easy condition under his rule, had but little cause
for complaint. But the greater part of the populace
were Zealots, clamorous to free themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
from their monarch. The soul of the revolt was
Justus, the son of Pistus, who wrote the history of
the war in which he was engaged, in the Greek
language. He was gifted with a persuasive tongue;
but his great influence was confined to the wealthy
and refined inhabitants of the city. Jesus ben Sapphia,
a Zealot like himself, led the lower classes of
sailors and burden-carriers. Opposed to these insurgents
was the aristocratic party, which rallied
loyally round the king and the Roman army. They
were represented by Julius Capellus, Herod ben
Miar, Herod ben Gamala, and Kompse bar Kompse,
but they had no following amongst the people, and
were obliged to become the unwilling spectators of
the surrender of their city to the revolutionists.</p>

<p>The news of the defeat of Cestius was the signal
for Justis and Jesus ben Sapphia to commence
operations against the heathen cities where their
co-religionists had been so barbarously massacred.
The city of Gamala, one of the most important on
the southeast coast of the Sea of Galilee, whose
impregnable position made defense easy and conquest
difficult, was preparing for revolt.</p>

<p>In the neighborhood of Gamala lived a settlement
of Judæan Babylonians, who, under Herod I,
had migrated to Batanæa, where they had built
several towns and the fortress of Bathyra. The
Babylonians, for the colony was called by this name,
were devoted adherents to the Herodian family, and
Philip, a grandson of Zamaris, the first founder of
the colony, was the leader of the royal troops who
fought against the Zealots in Jerusalem. When, however,
he had suffered defeat in that city, his life had
been spared, for he had promised to aid the Zealots
in their struggle against Rome. He lay concealed
for a few days in Jerusalem, and then effected his
escape to a village of his own near the fortress of
Gamala.</p>

<p>Varus, who temporarily was taking the place of
Agrippa in Cæsarea, did not look favorably upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
Philip, of whose influence with the king he was
jealous. For Varus hoped in time to supersede
Agrippa, and, in order to court popularity, resorted
to the cruel device of putting many Judæans in
Cæsarea Philippi to death. But all the while he
dreaded the Babylonian colony and the wrath of
Philip, who most certainly would divulge his ambitious
designs to Agrippa. Thus he tried to lure
Philip into his presence, but, happily for himself, that
general was seized with a severe attack of fever,
which he had caught in his flight from Jerusalem,
and which prevented him from obeying the summons
of Varus.</p>

<p>Varus succeeded, however, in tempting seventy
of the most distinguished Judæans into his power,
the greater number of whom were murdered by his
command. At the news of this assassination, terror
seized upon all the Babylonian Judæans who were
settled in the various cities of Galilee. They rushed
into Gamala for protection, breathing vengeance,
not only against Varus, but against all the Syrians
who had supported him. They were joined by
Philip, who with difficulty restrained them from
some signal act of vengeance. But even after
Agrippa had dismissed the unscrupulous Varus
from his office, the Babylonian Judæans still evinced
great eagerness to coalesce with the enemies of
Rome, and were therefore ordered to leave the
fortress of Gamala and return to Batanæa. But
this caused so great a tumult and division in the
city that some of the inhabitants rose and attacked
the Babylonians who were about to leave them,
whilst others, under the leadership of a certain
Joseph, revolted from the rule of Agrippa.</p>

<p>It was at this moment, when the volcano of revolutionary
passions was ever ready to burst forth
in fresh eruptions, that Joseph ben Matthias was
entrusted by the Great Synhedrion with the command
of Upper and Lower Galilee. In those provinces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
the powerful city of Sepphoris alone remained
faithful to the Romans, and in all Galilee there
reigned a bitter feeling of enmity against Sepphoris.
For the people of Tiberias were angered
that their city should have taken only a secondary
place in the province, in spite of Agrippa II's
having chosen it for his capital. It was the business
of the governor to promote a spirit of concord
amongst the inhabitants of Galilee, and at the same
time to win the Sepphorites to the popular cause.
Upon the shoulders of this man rested a heavy responsibility.
For it would naturally depend greatly
upon him whether this revolt, which had burst into
life with such extreme energy, would attain the end
desired by the patriots, or would have a tragic termination.
Unfortunately, Joseph was not the man
who could successfully pilot so gigantic a scheme,
but by his conduct he materially contributed to the
fall of the Judæan nation.</p>

<p>Joseph, the son of Matthias, better known as
Flavius Josephus, was a native of Jerusalem (born
38, died about 95), of illustrious priestly descent,
and related, on the female side, to the Hasmonæan
house. He and his brother Matthias received a
careful education, and were taught the tenets of the
Law whilst very young, their father's house being
frequented by learned rabbis. At the age of sixteen
Josephus became the disciple of the hermit
Vanus, following his master into the desert, living
on the wild fruits of the earth and bathing daily in
cold water, according to the habit of the Essenes.
But, growing weary of this life, he returned, after
three years, to Jerusalem, where his fine intellectual
tastes led him to a profound study of Greek literature.
At the age of twenty-six he had occasion to
undertake a journey to Rome, in order to plead for
two imprisoned Pharisees, in the presence of the
Empress Poppea, and he succeeded in obtaining
their freedom. The Empress, who entertained a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
friendly feeling toward the Judæans, loaded him
with gifts. Rome itself could not fail to exercise a
great influence upon the character of Josephus.
The glitter of Nero's court, the busy life of the
capital of the world, the immensity of all the imperial
institutions, so dazzled him that he thought
the Roman empire would be an eternal one and
that it was specially favored by Divine Providence.
He did not see concealed beneath the purple and
the gold the terrible disease of which that great
empire was sickening. From that moment Josephus
became a fervent adherent of the Roman rule.</p>

<p>Filled with enthusiastic admiration for Rome, he
must upon his return have found the proportions of
Judæa humble and dwarfed. How sarcastically he
must have smiled at the wild gestures of the frenzied
Zealots who dreamt of expelling the Romans from
Judæa! Such an expectation appeared to him like
the dream of a madman. With all the experiences
that he had gathered in his travels he tried to shatter
the revolutionary projects of the Zealots. But it
was useless; the people determined upon war,
seized their weapons, and rose to revolt. Josephus,
alarmed for his safety, took shelter with some of his
adherents in the Temple, whence he emerged only
upon hearing that the more moderate Zealots, under
the leadership of Eleazer, were placed in control of
affairs. Apprehensive that his well-known Roman
proclivities might make him an object of suspicion,
he simulated a desire for national liberty, whilst
secretly rejoicing at the prospect of the advance of
the Roman general Cestius, who, it was thought,
would soon put an end to this mad struggle for
freedom. But the result disappointed all his hopes.
The retreat of Cestius resembled a defeat.</p>

<p>Why Josephus, the devoted adherent of Rome,
should have been entrusted with the governorship
of the important province of Galilee is inexplicable.
Probably his friend, the former high priest Joshua,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
son of Gamala, whose voice carried great weight in
the Synhedrion, may have urged his claims, and
Josephus' dissimulation may have led those about
him to look upon him as a Zealot. But, at all
events, the heroic bearing of the insurgents and the
victory that they had gained over the army of
Cestius, cannot have failed to make upon Josephus,
as upon other plain and matter-of-fact Judæans,
a powerful impression. Entire separation
from the empire of Rome appeared to him an
impossible scheme; but he may have hoped that
some concessions were to be extorted from the
imperial court; that perhaps Judæa might be
handed over to the control of Agrippa, and that he
might be allowed to fill the post in Jerusalem. To
Agrippa himself the revolt was not quite unwelcome,
for he hoped to reap some benefit from it, and
through the agency of Josephus he was able to act
in a way which he himself could not have pursued as
a vassal of Rome. Josephus had, in fact, been working
for Agrippa, and, in so far, there was nothing
dishonest or traitorous in his conduct.</p>

<p>Two coadjutors, Joaser and Judah, were sent by
the Synhedrion to assist Josephus. They were
both learned in the Law, and were described by
him, now as pure and clean-handed, and again as
open to bribery. But they were quite unimportant
and soon disappeared from the scene of action.
At first Josephus seems to have been anxious to
promote the revolutionary ardor of the Galilæans.
He called a kind of Synhedrion together, consisting
of seventy men of repute, after the fashion of the
great council in Tiberias. He appointed seven
judges in each city, and officers of the law in different
parts of Galilee. He raised an army of a
hundred thousand men, armed and drilled them
according to the Roman system, and inculcated
order and discipline amongst his soldiers, qualities
indispensable to a nation of warriors, but less important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
to a people enthusiastic for liberty. He
even created a corps of cavalry and supported them
from his own means. He surrounded himself with
a body-guard of five hundred mercenaries, who were
disciplined to obey a sign from their master. He
began to fortify a number of cities in Upper and
Lower Galilee; and stored them with provisions.
Thus he seriously contemplated the defense of his
province against Rome. Upon his arrival in Galilee,
either inspired by the Synhedrion or impelled by
his own ardor, Josephus carried his religious zeal to
the extent of ordering the destruction of the palace
inhabited by his ancestor Herod during the time of
Augustus, where images of animals were worshiped
in direct defiance of the Law. In order to carry out
this design he invited the most distinguished men
of Tiberias to meet him at Bethmaon, but during
their discussion Jesus ben Sapphia set fire to the
palace and divided the spoil amongst his followers.
This displeased Josephus, who hastened into the
town of Tiberias, and gathering up what remained
of the plunder, handed it over into the custody of
King Agrippa's officers.</p>

<p>Peculiarly repugnant to Josephus was John of
Gischala; his untiring energy and intellectual superiority
were enough to awaken the jealousy of the
former, although Josephus, as the representative of
the Synhedrion, assumed the higher position of the
two. He took pains to place obstacles in the way of
the patriot. Thus John was at first not permitted to
carry off and sell the large quantity of corn stored
by the Romans in Upper Galilee, the sale of which
was to have enabled him to complete the fortification
of his own city. Joaser and Judah finally
extorted from Josephus the requisite authorization.
It was on this occasion that John of Gischala was
made painfully aware of the duplicity of the governor,
which for the future he determined to baffle.
Certain youths of a village called Dabaritta, near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
Mount Tabor, had waylaid and plundered the wife of
one of the king's agents who was traveling through
the land, and they brought the precious metals and
rich garments which they had taken from her to
Josephus, then at Tarichea. Out of too great a
regard for the king, Josephus undertook to return
this booty to him, at the same time falsely pretending
that he had sent it to Jerusalem for the national
treasury. The inhabitants of the neighboring villages,
roused to angry displeasure at the news of
Josephus' treachery, assembled at Tarichea in
crowds. They were led by Jesus ben Sapphia, who
came with the holy Book of the Law in his hand,
charging the people, if not for their own sakes, at
least for the honor of their sacred writings, to
punish the traitor. Josephus' house was surrounded
at daybreak by a furious throng, who would have
burnt it down over his head had he not saved himself
by one of his ingenious falsehoods. He rent his
clothes, poured ashes upon his head, hung a sword
round his neck, and appeared as a suppliant in the
arena of Tarichea. As soon as he could gain a
hearing he made the Taricheans believe that he was
not keeping the spoil, either for the use of Agrippa
or for the advantage of Jerusalem, but that it was to
enable him to fortify the walls of their own city.
The credulous Taricheans, who readily believed
this explanation, now declared themselves in favor
of Josephus, and turned their weapons upon the
discontented strangers. The governor meanwhile,
under cover of the tumult, crept back to his own
house, where, however, he was soon roused by some
hundreds of the infuriated crowd (not Taricheans),
who were utterly intractable, and were bent upon
the destruction of his dwelling-place. Nothing
daunted, Josephus appeared upon the roof, and
begged of the ringleaders to enter and give him
some reason for their conduct. The men allowed
themselves to be tempted within the doors, whereupon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
they were instantly seized, cruelly scourged,
maimed, and then cast out to their followers, who,
thinking Josephus must have some hidden force of
men concealed within, departed in consternation.
From that moment all hope of a manly defense of
Galilee had to be abandoned. Josephus was like a
demon of discord, to whose lot had fallen the task of
promoting a spirit of harmony amongst the people.
Galilee was divided into two parties, the one composed
of the more moderate inhabitants of that
province, who were the adherents of the governor,
the other numbering the fiery patriots, who could
no longer doubt his duplicity, and had selected John
as their leader. The two leaders hated each other
cordially, but equaled each other in craft and
dissimulation.</p>

<p>When John became aware that the greater number
of the Galilæans were under the impression
that Josephus was a truthful and reliable man, and
were supporting him with all their might, he sent
his brother Simon, with a hundred chosen followers,
to the Synhedrion at Jerusalem, there to lodge a
complaint against the governor, begging of the Great
Council to recall him from his post. The President
of the Synhedrion, Simon ben Gamaliel, who was a
friend of John, and who entirely discredited the
sincerity of Josephus, as well as Anan, the former
high priest, supported this charge, and decreed that
four envoys be sent to Galilee, with orders that
Josephus lay down his office, and that they be invested
with the power of bringing him, alive or
dead, to Jerusalem. The larger communities of
Tiberias, Sepphoris, and Gabara were instructed by
the Synhedrion to afford no protection to Josephus,
who was an enemy to his country, but to support
John of Gischala in his stead.</p>

<p>Once more Josephus was in great peril. But, as
usual, he saved himself by his own ready wit and
crafty policy. On the one hand, he would not give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
up the post which had become dear to him; and, on
the other, he did not wish to disobey the orders of
the Synhedrion. As soon as the decrees of the Great
Council were made known to him, through his
father, who was living in Jerusalem, he took his
precautionary measures. He pretended to be in
active preparation for a revolt from Rome, and
perplexed the envoys by the evasive replies he
gave them, assuring them, with a resigned air, when
they ordered him to depart instantly for Jerusalem,
that he was more than ready to lay down his office.
But all the while he was inciting the Galilæans to
hatred of the envoys, who, in traveling from one
town to another, found that they were not furthering
their mission, but that, on the contrary, they
were often in danger of being roughly handled by
Josephus' friends. Weary of this useless journeying,
the envoys, on the advice of John of Gischala,
sent secret messengers throughout Galilee, declaring
Josephus outlawed. A traitor revealed this
resolution to the governor. With an energy
deserving of a better cause, Josephus sent his
troops to guard the passes leading from the
Galilæan towns to Jerusalem, and had the messengers
seized and brought into his presence. He
then summoned all his devoted followers (who came
streaming from all the small towns and villages of
Galilee) to appear armed before him, and told them
he was the victim of a fiendish plot. This was
enough to lash them into a frenzy of rage, and they
would have torn the envoys to pieces had not
Josephus, with wonderfully assumed generosity,
quieted their wrath. He then sent for some of the
most simple-minded and credulous men of his
province whom he easily persuaded into going to
Jerusalem, there to extol his government, to entreat
of the Synhedrion to leave their beloved
governor at his post, and to recall the hated envoys.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, these latter, finding they could achieve
nothing in Upper Galilee, withdrew from that part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
of the province and appeared in Tiberias. But
Josephus was there before them, ready to frustrate
all their plans. In their extreme vexation and perplexity,
they had commanded the people to keep a
day of fasting and humiliation, when prayer was to
be offered up for Divine help, without which no
earthly weapons were of avail. The people answered
to this call by assembling in great numbers in the
arena of Tiberias, a place capable of holding many
thousands. Although every one was supposed to be
unarmed, Josephus and his soldiers managed to
conceal weapons under their cloaks. Prayers for
Divine help were followed by angry discussions; at
last, words gave place to action, and Josephus' followers,
drawing their arms, rushed frantically upon
his enemies. The populace sided with Josephus,
who was once more saved from deadly peril. Meanwhile,
the Galilæan messengers who had been sent
to Jerusalem produced so favorable an impression
for Josephus in that city, that the envoys were recalled,
and the governor reinstated in his official
post. Josephus revenged himself upon his enemies
by sending the envoys back to Jerusalem in chains,
thus treating the Synhedrion with contempt.</p>

<p>But whilst he was bringing civil war upon Galilee,
contempt upon the Synhedrion, disunion amongst
the patriots, whilst he was urging the important city
of Tiberias to rebellion, the Galilæan capital, Sepphoris,
with its Roman proclivities, had ample
time to make overtures to the Empire. Josephus
must bear the eternal opprobrium of having unmanned
and broken the one strong bulwark of
Judæa, the vigorous and warlike Galilee, and this he
accomplished through indecision, egotism, want of
tact, and above all, his extraordinary duplicity. He
certainly did strengthen some of the fortresses, or
rather he did not prevent their garrisons from
doing so, but when the Romans appeared in the
land they found neither an army nor a nation to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
oppose them. Every fortress had to depend upon
its own resources. The Galilæans, without confidence
in their leader, and exhausted by constant
strife, were becoming self-seeking if not cowardly.</p>

<p>It would indeed be difficult for us to believe the
numerous instances recorded of craft and duplicity
on the part of Josephus, had he not dwelt upon them
himself with unexampled shamelessness. All that
had been gained during the four months' rebellion
in Jerusalem was lost during the five fatal months
of his governorship of Galilee (from Nov., 66, to
March, 67), and this was before the enemy had even
threatened to appear, for the Romans during that
time had been inactive in Judæa. The Emperor
Nero was courting popular favor in Greece, by appearing
in the arena as singer, player, and charioteer.
Whilst engaged in these engrossing pursuits, there
came upon him like a thunderbolt the news of the
rising in Judæa and the defeat of the Roman army
under Cestius. Nero trembled, for the revolution
in Judæa might be the precursor of grave events.
The emperor was then apprised of the death of his
general Cestius, and none could tell whether he had
met with a natural death, or had died heartbroken
at his defeat.</p>

<p>Nero selected as his successor Flavius Vespasian,
who had won his laurels fighting against the Britons,
and who was known to be one of the ablest generals
of his time. But so great was the alarm felt at the
Judæan rebellion and its possible consequences, that
Licinius Mucianus was chosen as special governor
of Syria, and ordered to quell all dangerous symptoms
of disaffection that might appear among the
Parthians. Vespasian was not in the emperor's
favor at that time, and Nero would far rather have
given some other general his post; but the emperor
had no choice, for the ability of Vespasian was unquestionable,
and Judæa required a strong hand.
Vespasian started from Greece in the winter season,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
and commenced his preparations for the campaign
in Ptolemais. His son Titus, who first won renown
in fighting against the Judæans, brought two
legions from Alexandria, the fifth and tenth, those
wild Decumani whose cruelty, already experienced
by the Alexandrian Judæans, was now for the first
time to be felt by their Palestinean brethren. Vespasian
was met in Ptolemais by all who wished to
express their feelings of friendliness towards the
Romans; amongst others came Agrippa with his
sister Berenice. Agrippa had been accused by the
Tyrians of being in secret league with the rebellious
Judæans, and was therefore regarded with some
suspicion by Vespasian; but he came at the head
of his troops as a loyal subject-prince, whilst his
beautiful sister Berenice, still beautiful in spite of
having passed her first youth, captivated the general's
son Titus, and kept him enslaved for many
years to come.</p>

<p>Vespasian's army, consisting of Roman troops
and mercenaries, amounted to more than 50,000
men, besides the countless horde that was in the
habit of following in the wake of armies. Early in
the spring the army was equipped, and the campaign
began by the despatch of small bands to
clear the way of Judæan scouts, on the roads leading
to the fortified places. Vespasian, far more
prudent than his predecessor Cestius, instead of
displaying great energy, carried on the campaign
from beginning to end with extreme caution, seeking
to cut the ground, step by step, from under his
enemies' feet. Josephus and his troops were slowly
but surely driven back; in open battle he was often
shamefully defeated, for his men had no confidence
in his generalship, and his army literally melted
away at the sight of the enemy. With how different
a spirit were the followers of John of Gischala
inspired! As soon as the hostile forces approached
Jotapata, the inhabitants of that city offered desperate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
resistance, and although they could not break
through the serried ranks of the Romans, they
fought so bravely that they put the vanguard to
flight.</p>

<p>Vespasian determined upon effecting the subjection
of Galilee before turning his steps towards the
capital, and to accomplish this purpose he marched
upon the fortresses in the north of that province,
Gabara and Jotapata. The first, insufficiently fortified,
was soon taken and burnt. The entire population
of the garrison were put to the sword, to
avenge the defeat of the Romans at Jerusalem.
The unfortunate inhabitants of the entire district
suffered a similar fate, for they were either cruelly
butchered or sold into slavery. The war now became
one of revenge and extermination. But Josephus
remained far from the scene of action in his capital
at Tiberias, which at his flight thither was filled with
terror.</p>

<p>Josephus would gladly have gone over to the
enemy, but some remote feeling of shame prevented
him from taking this unpardonable step at the
beginning of the war. He proceeded to lay a statement
of the condition of his unhappy province before
the Synhedrion, demanded instruction as to his
movements, whether he was to resist the enemy
(in which case he would require reinforcements), or
whether he was to enter into negotiations with Vespasian.
The province of Galilee, although far more
thickly populated than Judæa, counting more than
three millions of souls, now already required military
aid, so terribly had it been weakened by Josephus'
inefficient management.</p>

<p>Vespasian marched from Gabara to Jotapata, but
his troops had to make their way with the greatest
difficulty, for the Judæans had endeavored to bar
the narrow passes and render the road impassable.
The rock upon which the fortress of Jotapata was
built is surrounded by steep and lofty hills, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
which it is separated by abrupt precipices. There
existed only one practicable entrance to the fortress,
and this was on the north side, but it was
firmly protected by a high wall bristling with towers.
Upon this wall were gathered all possible instruments
for repelling the enemy; great pieces of
rock, slings for throwing stones, bows and arrows,
and weapons of countless sorts. Against this one
approach all the efforts of the Romans were
directed. They confronted it with sixty storming
machines, from which, in one uninterrupted volley,
poured spears, stones, and slings containing ignitible
matter. But the besieged fought with such bitterness,
and with such cool contempt of death, that
even the Romans grew weary. The Galilæans not
only repulsed the storming parties, and often
destroyed their machinery, but they also made successful
sorties. The siege lasted more than forty
days, when at last, through the treachery of a Galilæan,
the fortress fell. Thus the Romans were able
to surprise the besieged at daybreak, when they
fell upon the exhausted sentinels, and then put the
garrison to the sword. Many, however, of their
devoted victims, rather than fall into the hands of
their terrible adversaries, sought death by flinging
themselves over the walls, or by falling on their
own weapons. Forty thousand men lost their lives
in this siege, and more than a thousand women and
children were sold into slavery, whilst the fortress
was razed to the ground. But Jotapata had shown
her unhappy country how to fall with honor and
glory. A few days previously Japha (Japhia) had
been taken, its men, both old and young, slaughtered,
and its women and children sold as slaves.</p>

<p>Josephus had been actually within the walls of
the fortress of Jotapata throughout the siege. He
had arrived from Tiberias at the first news of the
enemy's approach, and placed himself at the head of
the garrison. But divining rightly enough that all
resistance would eventually prove hopeless, he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
attempted to abandon his people, and had only been
prevented from doing this by the besieged. When
the Romans entered the fortress, Josephus sought
concealment in a huge cistern, in which hiding-place
he found forty of his own soldiers. When their
retreat was discovered, Josephus was called upon to
give himself up to the Romans. This exactly coincided
with his own wishes, as his person was to be
protected; but his companions, pointing their swords
against his breast, swore that sooner than allow him
to dishonor the Judæans by his cowardice they would
instantly take his life. Entirely at their mercy, he
consented to their proposal that they should all die
then and there. Each soldier swore that he would
fall by the hand of one of his companions, and each
in turn fell heroically. But Josephus broke his
word to the dead as he had broken it to the living.
He and one comrade being the only survivors,
he succeeded, partly by persuasion and partly by
force, in disarming his companion, and in delivering
himself into the hands of the Romans. Vespasian
treated him with extreme courtesy, as if he had
never looked upon him as an enemy. Although he
bore the semblance of a prisoner, he was allowed
to wear a robe of honor. Vespasian loaded him
with presents, Titus was his constant companion,
and he was permitted to select a wife from the captive
maidens.</p>

<p>Joppa's turn to fall before the conquerors soon
followed upon that of Japha and Jotapata, whilst
the people of Tiberias, thoroughly discouraged by
the conduct of Josephus, were not long in opening
the gates of their city to the Romans.</p>

<p>Thus, one year after the revolt in Jerusalem, the
greater part of the province of Galilee, which had
defended itself with all the fire of patriotism, with all
the zeal of a free country, and with all the enthusiasm
of its faith, was ruined, depopulated, and more
thoroughly than ever made subject to its conquerors.</p>

<p>It was upon this occasion that Agrippa proved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
that his conduct to the Judæans was not solely influenced
by his fear of the Romans. For Vespasian
gave him free control over them in his own province,
and he chose to sell those unfortunate people
into captivity, when he might either have chastised
them or given them their liberty.</p>

<p>The Galilæan Zealots were in possession of only
three fortified places&mdash;Gamala, Mount Tabor, and
Gischala&mdash;in the extreme north. Joseph of Gamala
and Chares were the leaders of the insurgents in
Gamala. All in vain had one of Agrippa's officers
besieged the place for some months; the Zealots
held out, until at last Vespasian with his force approached
the fortress. The story of the siege constitutes
one of the most heroic pages in the whole
account of the war. For many days the besieged
fought from their walls in a manner worthy of the
first great Zealot Judas. At the end of three weeks
the battering-rams of the Romans opened a breach
in the walls, through which the enemy crept. As
the besieged retired, their assailants followed them
into a labyrinth of narrow streets, and found themselves
suddenly attacked from the house-tops. The
Romans tried to save themselves by clambering on
some low-roofed houses, but these were too weak
to bear their weight and gave way, burying the men
in their ruins. The besieged then seized upon huge
stones&mdash;their whole city, so to speak&mdash;and hurled
them upon their enemies' heads, so that flight was
impossible.</p>

<p>This victory, falling upon the Feast of Tabernacles,
was a glorious day for the men of Gamala;
but it was dearly bought, for the corpses of the
Romans lay upon the bodies of many Judæan
warriors, who could ill be spared. Chares, one of
their leaders, was mortally wounded. At last the
Romans, after secretly mining one of the fortified
towers, made a feint of attacking it; the Judæans
rushed to the battlements, and were preparing for
defense, when the walls gave way and fell with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
fearful crash, burying the besieged, amongst whom
was the sole remaining leader, Joseph, the son of
the midwife. The siege was now practically over,
for the Romans poured in, and slaughtered every
man they met. Nearly five thousand died by their
own hands; only two maidens were left out of the
whole population of Gamala.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the fortress of Mount Tabor was
taken by the strategy of Placidus. It stood isolated
on an almost perpendicular height, rising sixteen
hundred feet from the plain of Jezreel. From its
position it was invincible. But Placidus tempted
the greater part of the garrison out of the fortress
by feigned flight. When his pursuers were close
upon him, his cavalry wheeled around and threw
themselves upon the unfortunate Judæans, of whom
some few fled to Jerusalem, whilst the weakened
fortress opened her gates to the enemy.</p>

<p>The small city of Gischala, garrisoned by very
few men, under the leadership of John, could not
possibly hold out against the Romans. Upon the
approach of Titus, John begged for a twenty-four
hours' truce before the capitulation of his fortress,
ostensibly to preserve the sanctity of the Sabbath.
Upon the acquiescence of the Roman general, he
made his escape from the city, followed by many
thousands of his people. On the morrow Gischala
capitulated, her gates were thrown open, and
her walls razed to the ground. But, indignant at
the conduct of the Judæan leader, Titus ordered
him to be hotly pursued. John succeeded, however,
in reaching Jerusalem with a remnant of his
army, whilst numbers of fugitives of both sexes and
of every age were captured and massacred by the
Roman soldiery. This was the last death-struggle
of besieged Galilee. But the Romans were so
thoroughly exhausted by those desperate encounters,
and their ranks were so much thinned by
their long warfare, that Vespasian was obliged to
declare a truce to hostilities.</p>

<p>Jerusalem was the rallying point of all the Galilæan
fugitives. Thither many thousands had been
brought by John of Gischala, and thither numbers
fled from Tiberias; there, where the last stroke of
the nation's destiny was to fall, patriotism, ambition,
revenge, and despair were all duly represented.
The Galilæan Zealots' burning account of their
desperate resistance to the Roman arms, and of
the massacre of the weak and defenseless by the
soldiers of Titus, had stirred the blood of the people
of Jerusalem. The despondent drew fresh courage,
and the fearless still greater ardor from the words of
these enthusiasts. The defenders of their country,
daily growing in numbers, and heroic in deed as
well as in word, considered themselves invincible.
When the Zealots looked upon the fortresses of
their capital, the last shadow of alarm melted away.
The Romans, they declared, must have wings to
take those walls and those towers, whose defenders
were iron-hearted men. Had it not cost Rome a
desperate struggle to conquer Galilee; what then
had the strongly fortified capital to fear? This
overwrought condition of the Judæans was stimulated
by their ardent belief that the Messianic period,
so long foretold by the prophets, was actually dawning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
when every other nation of the earth would be
given into the dominion of Israel. In spite of the
loss of Galilee and of its brave defenders, coins
were struck, bearing this inscription: "In the first
or second year of the deliverance or freedom of
Israel," and on the reverse side: "Simon, Prince
of Israel." But the Zealots were indulging in fatal
self-confidence, almost as dangerous to their cause
as the treachery of Josephus and the conquest of
Galilee.</p>

<p>Never had Jerusalem been so populous, so beautiful,
and so strong as at the moment when she was
doomed to destruction; it was as if she was to
learn the bitter lesson that outward strength and
outward glory alone are of but little avail. Within
the fortifications, the circumference of Jerusalem
was nearly one geographical mile in extent, embracing
the suburbs of Bethany and Bethphage, where
the worshipers who came up thrice a year to the
holy city found shelter. It is difficult to compute
the exact population of Jerusalem. From one
source we learn that it contained six hundred
thousand souls; but then we must further take into
account the numbers that had streamed into the
city for protection.</p>

<p>The Zealots had not succeeded in imparting their
enthusiasm to the inhabitants of the country towns;
many of the wealthiest and shrewdest, seeing no
possible advantage to themselves in the continuation
of the war, were ready to capitulate. Thus
only the very young and men of no worldly position
devoted themselves to the cause of the revolutionists.
Every community, every family, was
divided against itself, some clamoring for war and
others demanding peace; but as the former had no
rallying point in their own towns, they all sought
kindred spirits in Jerusalem, and increased the
number of Zealots in that city. The fortress of
Masada alone, commanded by Eleazer ben Jair, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
a hotbed of insurgents; it was the Jerusalem of the
Sicarii, who were strengthened by the leadership of
Simon Bar-Giora. This man, who was to play a
leading part in the war, was remarkable for his
physical strength, and distinguished for his reckless
courage, a quality which did not desert him until
his last breath. At the flight of the Roman troops
under Cestius he followed amongst the very first
upon the heels of the fugitives. He then gathered
a number of free-lances about him, and led
a wild life in the neighborhood of the Dead Sea,
namely in Acrabattine. When the inhabitants of
that district complained in Jerusalem that he imperiled
their safety, the moderate party of the Zealots
sent a troop against him, obliging him to take
refuge in Masada. It was from this place that he
and the Sicarii undertook armed expeditions into
Idumæa for the purpose of cattle-lifting and forage-hunting.
This roused the Idumæans to retaliate by
opposing his force with a large army numbering
twenty thousand men. These rival hosts outdid
each other in patriotism, fierce courage, and recklessness.</p>

<p>The stream of patriots daily pouring into Jerusalem
fanned the excitement and warlike energy
of the inhabitants, embittered as they were by Josephus'
duplicity and defection. For, as long as the
Judæans believed that he was buried under the
ruins of Jotapata, his name was mentioned with
reverence, but as soon as the tidings spread that he
was in the Roman camp, and treated with consideration
by the Roman generals, their feelings of
pity were changed into violent hatred. The ultra-Zealots
were filled with suspicion and distrust, and
they looked upon all who were not in favor of extreme
measures as traitors to the cause.</p>

<p>Eleazer ben Simon, the leader of the Zealots, and
a man of great penetration, nursed a special feeling
of hatred against the Synhedrion, a body that bound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
him, valiant and aspiring patriot as he was, to a life
of inaction. And who presided in the Synhedrion?
Josephus' friend and chosen companion, Joshua ben
Gamala, who had not attempted to depose the Governor
of Galilee, even when his duplicity was clearly
proved. And who was the treasurer? Antipas, a
Herodian, a near relative of King Agrippa. Was it
not more than likely that the Synhedrion and the
Herodians would throw open the gates of their city
at the approach of the Romans? This was the prevailing
feeling of the Zealots, and they believed
themselves strong enough to take the government
into their own hands, and by desperate exertions to
prosecute the war undisturbed.</p>

<p>It was not surprising that from day to day the
feeling of enmity between the Zealots and the more
moderate Synhedrists should grow in intensity, for
it was a war of life and death in which they were
engaged. Matters were brought to a crisis by the
Zealots falling upon and imprisoning those persons
whose relationship to the royal house and whose
doubtful opinions seemed to proclaim them to be
secret conspirators. But they did not halt at this
step. They degraded those belonging to the family
of the high-priest from their position, and replaced
them by representatives chosen from the people.
They determined upon divesting the high-priest of
his office (of late years the Romans had held the
conferring of this dignity in their own hands), and
raising to this exalted rank an unknown priest of
the name of Phineas ben Samuel, of the city of
Aphta. It was said of Phineas, probably to disparage
him, that he had originally been a stone-mason
or an agriculturist. He was brought by the
Zealots with due solemnity from his homely surroundings,
was invested with the priestly garments,
and was materially aided by his rich friends to maintain
the dignity of his state, whilst Matthias ben
Theophilus, who had been chosen high-priest by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
Agrippa, was deposed. The Synhedrists, whose
leaders belonged principally to the high-priesthood,
and who looked upon the instalment of Phineas as
an outrage to their sacred calling, were beside themselves
with indignation at this step. Anan, whose
audacity of speech and great wealth entitled him
to a prominent position in the Synhedrion, induced
the citizens of Jerusalem to rebel, and to attack the
Zealots sword in hand, and thus the civil war commenced.
The moderate party, who were numerically
the stronger, drove their antagonists step by
step out of every district of the city up to the Mount
of the Temple, where they forced them to take
refuge within the second wall of the citadel. Meanwhile,
a rumor spread that Anan had called upon
the Roman general for help. This was enough to
bring John of Gischala with his troops to the gates
of the capital. Twenty thousand Idumæans, men
who rejoiced in an appeal to reckless and savage soldiery,
under the leadership of John, Simon, Phineas,
and Jacob, appeared likewise before Jerusalem,
ready to wield their swords in favor of the Zealots
who were besieged in the Temple. Anan prepared
for the assault by barring the gates and doubling his
sentinels. But in the ensuing night his troops
were seized with a panic. A terrific storm of
thunder, lightning, and drenching rain raged over
Jerusalem. The Idumæans, men of bold character
and hardy nature, did not flinch from their position,
but many of the sentinels on the walls sought
shelter from the violence of the elements and deserted
their posts. The ever-watchful Zealots within
the fortifications were thus able to communicate with
their Idumæan allies and to effect their entrance.
The besiegers threw themselves upon some of the
unsuspecting watch, whilst the Zealots overpowered
others. The citizens were roused to arms and a
terrible battle ensued. The moderate party laid
their weapons down in despair, as the Idumæans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
pouring into the city massacred all those whom they
suspected of being friendly to Anan. The morning
sun dawned upon a hideous mass of corpses, for
more than 8000 dead bodies were found in the city.</p>

<p>The Zealots were now the victors, and their
reign of terror began. They committed to trial,
not without some show of justice, and then executed,
all persons suspected of having been concerned in
the conspiracy. Anan and Joshua ben Gamala
were necessarily amongst the victims, and the bitterness
which was felt towards them was so great
that their unburied bodies were thrown to the dogs.
The Synhedrion naturally ceased to exist, so many
of its members having been executed; but a new
Synhedrion seems to have been called into being
by the Zealots, no longer of aristocratic and high-priestly
elements, but rather of a democratic order,
also numbering seventy members.</p>

<p>The Idumæans were as heartily disliked by the
Zealots as they were by the moderate party, and
many of them were courteously persuaded to withdraw
from Jerusalem. Meanwhile the reign of
terror continued, and amongst others fell Niger, the
hero from Peræa, probably because he had upheld
the Synhedrists. In fact, this one case corroborates
the general rule that every revolution devours its
originators. For Niger was one of those who had
strained every nerve to support the first rising
amongst the Judæans, and his death was a blot upon
the rule of the Zealots. In order to check the
anarchy which followed the overthrow of the Synhedrion,
John of Gischala threw himself boldly into
the front ranks, and was warmly supported by the
Galilæan fugitives. His heroic bearing soon secured
him the following of the most fiery of the Judæans,
whose devotion to himself rivaled that of his own
Galilæans. John was born to be a leader of men;
for not only was he dauntless as a commander, but
he excelled others in penetration and fertility of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
invention. This superiority naturally awakened the
jealousy of the Zealot leaders in Jerusalem, who
were not a little afraid of his becoming sole dictator
and lawgiver.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Romans were remaining absolutely
quiet. Vespasian was far too prudent to
attack the lion in his lair, in spite of the repeated
assurances of his followers that the conquest of
Jerusalem would be an easy task. He chose to wait
until the Judæans, weakened by their internal strife,
would be entirely at his mercy. His troops, after
spending an inactive winter (67&ndash;68), opened a new
campaign in the spring against Peræa and many distant
parts of Judæa, where thousands were slain
in obstinate and hard fighting. Vespasian returned
to Cæsarea at the end of this campaign, and left
Jerusalem undisturbed for two years. He was led to
this course by two different events: the fresh outburst
of civil war in Jerusalem, the death of Nero,
and the fact that his successor had been chosen and
triumphantly installed by the Spanish and Gallic
legions.</p>

<p>The lawless Simon Bar-Giora, who had kindled
the war in Jerusalem, could not rest in Masada,
where the Sicarii had received him, for he was
ambitious and eager for action. Thus he left the
fortress, and collecting a number of slaves, to whom
he held out promises of freedom and plunder,
appeared before Jerusalem, ready to play an important
part in the war. But the Zealots were
afraid of him, and wished to make him powerless.
They did not dare meet him in open battle, for
he had already been their conqueror; so they
waited in ambush, and made his wife and some
of his soldiery prisoners, hoping to crush him by
this cowardly action. But Bar-Giora was a stern-hearted
warrior, and, in retaliation, threw himself
upon the defenseless Judæans who ventured outside
the walls to procure the necessaries of life. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
Judæans, alarmed at this revenge, sent back his
wife, while Bar-Giora was more determined than
ever to make himself master of the capital. Day
and night he waited and watched for some means
of ingress, and at last he obtained what he wished
through the party of the aristocrats.</p>

<p>In spite of the loss of their most prominent men,
this party had not really ceased to exist, but was
secretly working to destroy the power of the Zealots.
At their head stood the high-priest Matthias, the
son of Boëthus, and others belonging to the great
priestly families. They knew how to enlist upon
their side many of the populace who were unable
to leave the city, and who were afraid of the consequences
of the civil war. In league with the
Idumæans, they suddenly made a well-directed
attack upon the Zealots, over whom they gained a
signal, but only a momentary advantage, for, recovering
themselves from this defeat, the Zealots
assembled upon the Mount of the Temple, and prepared
to show a bold front to their opponents.
The latter, much discomfited, appealed to Bar-Giora
for assistance, and thus a fatal division was
brought within the very walls of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>With the entry of this commander, civil war
began in its most terrible form. Bar-Giora commanded
his followers to surround the Mount of the
Temple, where the Zealots lay entrenched. From
the galleries and from the roofs the besieged were
able not only to defend themselves, but also to
repulse their assailants. In spite of his impatience,
Bar-Giora was obliged to withdraw and to take up
a safer position in the town.</p>

<p>Vespasian, who was informed of all these movements,
quietly bided his time, convinced that the
losing side would sooner or later demand his help,
and that then victory would be easy. He felt indisposed,
through various circumstances, to undertake
a long and difficult siege, but was inclined rather to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
keep his hands free for the final struggle. Nero
had ended his shameful life with a shameful death
(68), and Galba, who succeeded him as emperor,
held the reins of power with an aged and trembling
grasp. Old and childless, he had to think of
choosing a successor. At this critical time, when
every day was pregnant with some important event,
Vespasian did not think it prudent to devote himself
to the siege of Jerusalem. He adopted a
waiting, watchful policy, and sent his son Titus with
King Agrippa to Rome to receive the new emperor,
and, as people said, to be adopted by him as
heir to his vast empire. But when Titus heard,
upon arriving in Corinth, that Galba had been
murdered (5 Jan., 69), and that two emperors had
been elected by the legions in his stead&mdash;Otho in
Rome, and Vitellius in Lower Germany, he hurried
back to Judæa, not only buoyed up by the secret
hopes of seeing his father created emperor in
the general confusion which was pending, but also
attracted by a powerful magnet, the beautiful
Princess Berenice, who, in spite of living according
to orthodox Judæan custom, did not hesitate to
carry on an intrigue with the heathen Titus. Otho
could retain possession of the purple only for
one hundred days, at the end of which time he
found himself forced to fight against Vitellius,
whom the German legions had borne upon their
shields, by way of teaching the Spanish legions
that they were fittest to choose and instal an
emperor. They also wished to make it evident
that the emperor need not owe his election only
to Rome and the Prætorian Guard, but should be
the choice also of the legions in the provinces.
Vitellius' army gained the victory, and Otho, after
brave resistance, fell by his own hand. Meanwhile
Vespasian was dreaming of the moment when he
should drape himself in the stained imperial mantle,
but he hesitated before putting his scheme into execution.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
He wished to be driven to it. Partly, he
feared Licinius Mucianus, governor of Syria, who
commanded more legions than he did, and with
whom he was not on very friendly terms. But
Vespasian's son Titus, who made no secret of his
ambition, won over Mucianus to urge his father
into allowing himself to be proclaimed emperor.
It was also absolutely essential to obtain the support
of Tiberius Alexander, the son of the Alabarch
and the governor of that most important province&mdash;Egypt.
This move in the great game was due to
the hand of a woman. The Princess Berenice
was a friend of the Egyptian governor, and she
was furthering the imperial election as an affair
of the heart. Titus' love for her was so openly
avowed that all her court were convinced that
he had promised her marriage. It was therefore
not unnatural that she should employ all the means
suggested by her imagination, and made possible
by her personal charms, to attain this end. The
most important step was to gain Tiberius Alexander's
support for Vespasian, and in this she
succeeded admirably. The governor of Egypt
responded to her appeal by making his legions
swear fealty to him whom they now called emperor.
A few days later the legions stationed in Judæa, and
the Syrian troops under the command of Mucianus,
also tendered their allegiance to Vespasian. The
possession of the coveted purple was enough to
make Vespasian for the time being forgetful of the
conquest of Judæa. Accompanied by his son Titus,
he repaired to Egypt, where they received the news
of Vitellius' death (Dec., 69), an event which had
drawn forth but the contemptuous scorn of his
people.</p>

<p>And how did Jerusalem spend the two years
of peace that Vespasian granted her? There were
originally four distinct factions in the city, without
counting the more moderate. These were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
Jerusalem Zealots under Eleazer ben Simon and
Simon ben Ezron, consisting only of two thousand
four hundred members, the Galilæan Zealots under
John, numbering six thousand armed men, the
Simonists and Sicarii outnumbering the rest by
their army of ten thousand, and the Idumæans
under Jacob ben Sosa and Simon ben Kathla, a
troop of five thousand men. These twenty-four
thousand heroic patriots might have put their valor
to some account in one decisive battle could they
but have acted in harmony. But not one of their
leaders was capable of sacrificing his own ambition
to the general good. The followers of Eleazer
claimed precedence on the grounds of their being
natives of Jerusalem and of having thus given the
first impulse to the movement. John insisted upon
his superiority on account of his quickness of perception
and readiness in action, and Simon felt
revengeful towards the Zealots, who had dared
quell his disorder. Members of the four different
factions were perpetually meeting and fighting in the
streets, giving the enemy both the time and the
opportunity to devastate the surrounding country;
for it was almost certain that no one faction would
dare oppose the Romans, and equally certain that
the four factions would not combine in arms against
them.</p>

<p>Titus, the new heir to the imperial throne, at last
made his appearance before Jerusalem (February,
70), fully expecting that he would be able to force
the city into submission; for it was almost a reproach
to the Romans that this rebellious capital should
have maintained her independence for four years.
The prestige of the new imperial house seemed in
some measure to depend upon the fall of Jerusalem;
a protracted siege would necessarily imply weakness
in the military power of Vespasian and his son.</p>

<p>Although Titus was eagerly looking forward to
the subjection of Judæa, he could not complete his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
preparations for the siege of Jerusalem before the
spring. He collected an army of not less than
eighty thousand men, who came, bringing with them
the largest number of battering machines that had
been used in the warfare of that time. Three
traitors amongst the Judæans were most useful to
him in his laborious undertakings&mdash;King Agrippa,
who not only brought a contingent of men, but who
also tried to influence the inhabitants of Jerusalem
in favor of the Romans; Tiberius Alexander, who
sealed his apostasy from Judaism by going into
battle against his own nation; and Josephus, the
constant companion of Titus, who, from being a
prisoner, had become a guide in the country which
he knew so well. Titus was not experienced enough
in the art of war, and so bade the Judæan apostate
stand by his side, and gave him the command of
his own body-guard (Præfectus prætorio). But the
hostile factions had drawn together when this new
danger threatened them. Shortly before the Passover
festival numbers of devoted men streamed into
Jerusalem to defend their holy city. The elders and
chiefs had sent messengers to the people living in
the outlying provinces, praying for help, and their
request was not made in vain. The walls of Jerusalem
were fortified more strongly than ever.</p>

<p>At last Titus assembled his huge army from all
sides and encamped at Scopus-Zophim, north of
Jerusalem. He summoned in the first instance the
inhabitants to surrender; he demanded only submission,
acknowledgment of the Roman rule, and
payment of the taxes. Eager as he was to return
to Rome, where all the enjoyments belonging to his
great position were awaiting him, he was ready to
deal gently with the Judæans. Besides which, his
devotion to a Judæan princess, who, in spite of her
errors, still clung faithfully to the holy city, made
him anxious to spare that city from destruction.
But the Judæans refused all negotiation. They had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
sworn to defend their city with their lives, and would
not hear of surrender. Then the siege began in
earnest. All the gardens and groves to the north
and west of Jerusalem, the first points of the attack,
were unsparingly destroyed.</p>

<p>Titus, anxious to reconnoitre the ground, advanced
with a few followers to the north wall, where he narrowly
escaped being taken prisoner. The first feat
of arms upon the part of the Judæans was crowned
with success, and seemed a good omen for the
future. A few days later they surprised and totally
discomfited the Tenth Legion, who were pitching
their tents on the Mount of Olives. But, unfortunately,
this skirmish proved fruitless, for the Judæans
were always obliged to retreat to their fortresses,
not, however, without having convinced the
Romans that they would have a desperate foe to
encounter. The besiegers succeeded in pitching
their camps on three sides of the city, and in raising
their engines against the outer wall. Titus commenced
operations during the Passover festival
(March or April, 70), when he believed that the
Judæans would not be willing to fight. But as soon
as the engines were in working order, they rushed
like demons from their retreat, destroying the battering-rams,
scattering the workmen, and bringing
alarm and confusion upon the enemy. Not only the
Zealots, but all who could carry arms took part in
the defense, the women setting splendid examples
of heroism to the men. The besieged threw masses
of stone upon their assailants, poured boiling oil
upon their heads, seized the ponderous missiles that
were hurled into the city, and turned them into
tools of destruction against the Romans. But the
latter succeeded in repairing their broken battering-rams,
and in forcing the Judæans, after fifteen days
of conflict, back from the outer wall. This wall, the
scene of a desperate struggle, was at last taken by
the Romans, who, while making themselves masters
of it, seized the suburban town of Bezetha.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
The skirmishes were now carried on daily, and
with increasing bitterness. After seventeen days
of unremitting labor, the Romans succeeded in
raising their banks opposite the Antonine tower.
But John of Gischala and some heroic followers of
Bar-Giora, creeping through a subterranean passage,
destroyed these works by setting fire to them.
With the ever-increasing danger grew the heroism
of the besieged. All Josephus' persuasive words,
prompted by Titus, were useless. There were but
two courses left open to them&mdash;victory or death.
At the very outset of the siege they had learned
what they would have to expect from the Romans.
Titus, surnamed "Delight of all Mankind," crucified,
at times, five hundred of his prisoners in a day.
Again, he would send them back into the city after
cutting off their hands. He was, however, forced to
acknowledge to himself that the siege would be one
of long duration. But the horrors of famine were
soon to come to his assistance. All egress from
and ingress into the besieged city being rigorously
prevented, the provisions began to fail amongst the
thickly-crowded populace. Houses and streets were
filled with unburied corpses, and the pangs of starvation
seemed to destroy all feelings of pity in the
unfortunate survivors. The prospect&mdash;a terrible
one indeed&mdash;of a lingering death sent numbers
of deserters to the Romans, where they met with
a pitiful fate. As the number of these unfortunate
fugitives increased, the Zealots treated those whom
they suspected of defection with still greater severity.
A conspiracy being discovered amongst Bar-Giora's
followers, that leader relentlessly punished the guilty
with death. They were all beheaded in full view of
the Roman camp, amongst them being Matthias
Boëthus, of priestly family.</p>

<p>But in spite of the watchfulness of the Zealots,
they were unable to circumvent the traitors in all
their designs. Those who were secretly friendly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
to Rome shot off on their arrow-heads written
accounts concerning the state of the city, which
fell into the enemy's camp. The Zealots struggled
manfully to prevent the Romans from completing
their earthworks, but at the end of twenty-one
days, the battering-rams were again pointing at the
Antonine tower. The wall surrounding the fortress
fell at length under the tremendous blows from without.
What was the surprise and horror of the
Romans, however, when they discovered that a
second and inner wall had been erected behind the
one they had succeeded in destroying. They tried
in vain to storm it, the Judæans repulsing a nocturnal
attack. The battle lasted until the following
morning. It was at about this time that the daily
sacrifices ceased, on account of the scarcity of the
animals. Titus seized this opportunity again to
summon the besieged to surrender, but the mere
sight of the interpreter who bore the message
aroused the indignation of the besieged. John of
Gischala replied that the holy city could not be
destroyed, and that God held her fate in His hands.
The Judæans then withdrew to their last point of
defense, the Temple. The battering-rams were
raised against the sacred walls. The unfortunate
people were compelled to destroy the colonnades
leading to the Antonine tower, thus cutting off all
connection with that fortress. They spared no craft
to tire out the Romans, even setting fire to some of
the pillars attached to the Temple, and then pretending
to take flight. This stratagem succeeded
in making the Romans climb over the walls, beyond
which the Judæans lay in ambush to receive them,
putting them to the sword or casting them into the
flames. But the fire could not be extinguished, and
the beautiful colonnade of the western side was
entirely destroyed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the inhabitants of the city were suffering
cruelly from famine, which was sapping their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
life, obliterating all distinctions between rich and
poor, and giving free scope to the lowest passions.
Money had lost its value, for it could not purchase
bread. Men fought desperately in the streets over
the most loathsome and disgusting food, a handful
of straw, a piece of leather, or offal thrown to the
dogs. The wealthy Martha, wife of the High Priest
Joshua ben Gamala, whose wont it had been to step
on carpets from her house to the Temple, was found
searching the town like the very poorest for a morsel
of food, of even the most revolting description.
As if not one line of the old prophecy concerning the
doom of Judæa was to remain unfulfilled, a terrible
scene was enacted, which struck even the enemy
with horror. A woman by the name of Miriam, who
had fled from Peræa to the capital, actually killed
and devoured her own child.</p>

<p>The rapidly increasing number of unburied
corpses made the sultry summer air pestilential,
and the populace fell a prey to sickness, famine,
and the sword. But the army of the besieged
fought on with unbroken courage, they rushed to
the battle-field, although fainting with hunger and
surrounded by grim pictures of death, as bravely
as had been their wont in the early days of the
siege. The Romans were amazed at the unflinching
heroism of the Zealots, at their devotion to the
Sanctuary and to the cause of their people. In fact,
they grew to look upon them as invincible, and
stimulated by this belief, some few of their number
were actually known to desert their colors and their
faith and to accept Judaism, persuaded, in their turn,
that the holy city could never fall into the hands of
the enemy. Proud as the Judæans well might be
of these voluntary proselytes, at this the supreme
moment of their history, they volunteered to guard
them as best they could from the horrors of
starvation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Romans had begun to batter the
outer walls of the courts of the Temple. For six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
days they had been working in vain, and had then
tried to fix their scaling ladders and storm the walls.
But as they were repulsed with great loss of life,
Titus relinquished his hope of sparing the sacred
edifice, and ordered his men to set fire to the gates.
For a whole night and the next day the fire raged
fiercely; then Titus commanded that it should be
extinguished, and that a road should be leveled for
the advance of his legions. A council of war was
hastily summoned to decide upon the fate of the
Sanctuary. This council consisted of six of the
chief generals of the army, three of whom advised
the destruction of the Temple, which, if spared,
would inevitably remain as a focus for rebellion.
Titus was opposed to this decision, partly on account
of the Princess Berenice's feelings, and three
of the council agreeing with their leader, it was
decided to take the Temple, but not to destroy it.</p>

<p>On the 9th Ab, the Judæans made another desperate
sally, but were driven back by an overpowering
force of the besiegers. But the hour of the
city's doom was about to strike, and in striking,
leave an echo that would ring through the centuries
to come. The besieged attempted one more furious
onslaught upon their enemies. They were again
defeated, and again driven back to their sheltering
walls. But this time they were closely followed by
the Romans, one of whom, seizing a burning firebrand,
mounted upon a comrade's shoulders, and
flung his terrible missile through the so-called
golden window of the Temple. The fire blazed
up; it caught the wooden beams of the sanctuary,
and rose in flames heavenwards. At this sight the
bravest of the Judæans recoiled terror-stricken.
Titus hurried to the spot with his troops, and
shouted to the soldiers to extinguish the flames.
But no one heeded him. The maddened soldiery
plunged into the courts of the Temple, murdering
all who came within their reach, and hurling their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
firebrands into the blazing building. Titus, unable
to control his legions, and urged by curiosity, penetrated
into the Holy of Holies.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Judæans, desperate in their death
agonies, closed wildly with their assailants. The
shouts of victory, the shrieks of despair, the fierce
hissing of the flames, making the very earth tremble
and the air vibrate, rose in one hideous din, which
echoed from the tottering walls of the Sanctuary to
the mountain-heights of Judæa. There were congregated
clusters of trembling people from all the
country round, who beheld in the ascending flames
the sign that the glory of their nation had departed
forever. Many of the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
unwilling to outlive their beloved Temple, cast
themselves headlong into the burning mass. But
thousands of men, women, and children, in spite of
the fierce onslaught of the legions and the rapidly
increasing flames, clung fondly to the inner court.
For had they not been promised by the persuasive
lips of false prophets, that God would save them by
a miracle at the very moment of destruction? They
fell but an easier prey to the Romans, who slew
some six thousand on the spot. The Temple was
burnt to the ground, and only a few smouldering
ruins were left, rising like gigantic ghosts from the
ashes. A few of the priests had escaped to the
tops of the walls, where they remained without food
for some days, until they were compelled to surrender.
Titus ordered their instant execution, saying,
"Priests must fall with their Temple." The conquering
legions raised their standards in the midst
of the ruins, sacrificed to their gods in the Holy
Place, and saluted Titus as emperor. By a strange
coincidence the second Temple had fallen upon the
anniversary of the destruction of the first Temple
(10th Ab, 70). Titus, who could no longer feel
bound to respect the feelings of the Princess Berenice,
gave orders that the Acra and the Ophla,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
different parts of the city, should be instantly set
on fire.</p>

<p>But the struggle was not yet over. The leaders
of the rebellion had retreated to the upper city with
some of their followers. There they conferred with
Titus. John and Simon, having sworn that they
would never lay down their arms, offered to surrender
upon the condition that they would be permitted
to pass armed through the Roman camp.
But Titus sternly bade them throw themselves upon
his mercy; and so the fierce strife blazed out anew.
On the 20th of Ab, the Romans began to raise
their embankments, and after eighteen days of
labor the siege of the upper city commenced.
Even then the Zealots would not think of surrender.
Discovering that the Idumæans were secretly making
terms with Titus, they threw some of the ringleaders
into prison, and executed others. But the
Judæan warriors were exhausted by their super-human
resistance and by the long famine, and the
Romans were at last able to scale the walls and to
seize the fortresses, a prelude to their spreading
through the city, plundering and murdering the
last of the wretched inhabitants. On the 8th of
Elul they set fire to all that remained of Jerusalem,
the upper city, known by the name of Zion. The
walls were entirely leveled, Titus leaving only the
three fortresses of Hippicus, Mariamne, and Phasael
to stand as lasting witnesses of his victory.
Under the ruins of Jerusalem and her Temple lay
buried the last remnant of Judæa's independence.
More than a million of lives had been lost during
the siege. Counting those who had fallen at Galilee,
Peræa, and the provinces, it may be assumed
that the Judæans who inhabited their native land
were almost all destroyed.</p>

<p>Once more did Zion sit weeping amongst the
ruins, weeping over her sons fallen in battle, over
her daughters sold into slavery or abandoned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
the savage soldiery of Rome; but she was more
desolate now than in the days of her first captivity,
for hushed was the voice of the prophet, who
once foretold the end of her widowhood and her
mourning.</p>

<p>It would, indeed, be difficult to describe the sufferings
of those who were taken captive in the war,
estimated at the number of nine hundred thousand.
The surviving inhabitants of Jerusalem were driven
into the site of the Temple, and placed under the
guardianship of a certain Fronto and a freed slave.
All those who were recognized as insurgents were
crucified, the princes of Adiabene alone being
spared and sent as hostages to Rome, to secure the
loyalty of the king of Adiabene. Seventeen thousand
prisoners died of hunger, many of them being
neglected by Fronto, whilst others indignantly refused
the food which their conquerors offered them.
From amongst the youths above seventeen years
of age, the tallest and handsomest were selected
for the Roman triumphs, whilst others were sent
to labor in the mines for the rest of their lives, or
were relegated to the Roman provinces, to take
their part in the fights of the arena. Youths under
the age of sixteen and most of the female captives
were sold into slavery at an incredibly low
price, for the market was glutted. How many
scenes of horror must have been witnessed and
enacted by those unfortunate ones! They had,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
it is true, one ray of comfort left. Possibly they
might be carried to some Roman town where a
Judæan community existed; their own people would
assuredly give any sum to purchase their freedom,
and would then treat them with brotherly sympathy.</p>

<p>Vespasian now declared that all Judæa was his
property by conquest, and bade the Roman officials
divide the country into lots, offering them to the
highest bidder. And why should he not do so?
Had he not fertilized the land with blood? Besides
which, the sale would realize great profits,
and Vespasian cared even more for gold than for
honor.</p>

<p>And what was the work of the merciful Titus after
ordering the execution of thousands, and consigning
thousands to slavery? In his march through
Syria he was followed by the most vigorous of his
captives in chains. When he held his court in
Cæsarea, and entertained his friends in true Roman
style, wild beasts were brought into the arena,
and Judæan captives fought with them until they
were torn to death; or they were forced to fight
one against another, dying by each other's hands.
Thus at Cæsarea, two thousand five hundred
brave Judæan youths perished in this manner to
celebrate the birthday of Domitian, the brother
of the conqueror. And at Cæsarea Philippi, on
Mount Hermon, the residence of King Agrippa,
this terrible spectacle was renewed before the
eyes of that monarch and of the Princess Berenice.
Vespasian's birthday was honored in the same way
at Berytus, the sand of the arena being literally
soaked with Judæan blood. In fact, the gentleness
and humanity of Titus were strangely displayed
in all cities of Syria by a repetition of
these barbarities. The Judæan communities in
Syria, Asia Minor, Alexandria, and Rome, very
nearly shared the fate of their brethren in Judæa.
For the war had aroused the hatred of the entire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
heathen world against the unfortunate children of
Israel&mdash;a hatred which was fanatical in its intensity,
its object being the entire destruction of the whole
race. Titus' inmost feelings must have coincided
with those of his people. But strange to say, his
love for Berenice, so deeply implanted in his heart,
made him, upon one occasion, extend his mercy to
her race. When he approached the city of Antioch,
the whole populace turned out to meet him and
demanded nothing less than the expulsion of the
Judæan colony. But Titus replied that "The
Judæans having no country left to them, it would
be inhuman to expel them from Antioch&mdash;they had
no retreat." He even refused sternly to cancel
their existing privileges. The Alexandrian Judæans
also were left undisturbed in their adopted
city.</p>

<p>Titus determined to celebrate his triumph over
Judæa in the capital of the empire. For this purpose
seven hundred of the flower of the Judæan
captives and the two leaders of the Zealots, John of
Gischala, who had surrendered to the enemy when
fainting with hunger, and Simon Bar-Giora, were
sent to Rome. At the close of the siege of Jerusalem
the dauntless Simon had leaped, with some of
his followers, into one of the vaults beneath the city,
and provided with workmen's tools, had attempted
to hew his way out; but coming upon a great rock
he was prevented from accomplishing his purpose,
and his slender stock of provisions failing him, he
determined to die as became a hero. In a white
robe, covered with a purple mantle, he suddenly
appeared before the Roman sentinels who were
reposing amongst the ruins of the Temple. They
gazed at him with terror. He merely addressed
them with the following words: "Take me to your
general." When Rufus appeared at the sentinels'
call, the leader of the Zealots presented himself
before his astonished gaze, saying: "I am Simon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
Bar-Giora." He was instantly thrown into chains,
and calmly awaited the fate that he knew was in
store for him.</p>

<p>Vespasian and his two sons, Titus and Domitian,
celebrated their triumph over Judæa, in the imperial
city of Rome. In front of the emperor
were borne the vessels of the Temple, the seven-branched
candlestick, the golden table, and a roll
of the Law. The Romans were further gladdened
by the pageant of a long train of Judæan captives
heavily chained, and by the wonderful representations
of all the horrors and misery of the war&mdash;a
kind of theatrical entertainment, devised with
much ingenuity for the occasion. Simon Bar-Giora
(the terrible foe of the Roman legions), with
a halter round his neck, was dragged through
the streets of Rome, and finally hurled as a human
sacrifice to the gods, from the Tarpeian rock.
John of Gischala met with his fate in a dungeon.
Tiberius Alexander, the conqueror of his own race,
shared in the triumph, and a statue was erected
in his honor in the Forum. Josephus was but a
spectator of the scene. This magnificent triumph,
the like of which had not been witnessed for many
years in Rome, was a proof of the exultant joy,
which passed like a wave over the heathen world,
at the fall of Judæa, for the Roman legions had
but rarely met with so obstinate a foe. To commemorate
this great victory, coins were struck,
upon which Judæa was variously represented, as
a sorrowing woman under a palm tree, either
standing with fettered hands, or seated in a despairing
attitude upon the ground. The coins bore
these inscriptions, "the Conquered" or "the Captive
Judæa" ("Judæa devicta," "Judæa capta").
Later on, a beautiful arch was erected to Titus,
which is still standing, and upon which the carved
reliefs of the candlestick and vessels of the Temple
are plainly visible. The Roman Judæans, not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
at that time, but in years to come, would take a
longer or more circuitous route, to avoid seeing
this trophy. The rich spoils of the Sanctuary were
deposited in the Temple of Peace, and the roll of
the Law in the imperial palace; but at a later time,
when Rome was expiating her heavy sins, these
relics of the glory of Jerusalem were carried to
other countries.</p>

<p>Judæa was not yet entirely subjugated, for
three strong fortresses were still in arms: Herodium,
Machærus, and Masada. The governor,
Bassus, sent by Vespasian to Judæa, was commanded
to take them. Herodium surrendered
immediately, but Machærus offered a stubborn
resistance. This fortress, built by Alexander
Jannæus, was well defended from the enemy by
its natural position. Steep precipices and yawning
ravines made it impregnable. But it fell&mdash;and in
this way: The young commander, Eleazer, a valiant
hero, was captured by the Romans, whilst fearlessly
standing without the gates, proudly reliant
upon the terror of his arms. Bassus ordered him
to be scourged within view of the besieged, and
then made semblance of having him crucified. A
wail of despair went up from the fortress; the
besieged, determined to save their beloved comrade,
offered to give up their citadel if his life were
spared. Bassus agreed to this proposal, and the
garrison was saved; but of the inhabitants of the
lower town, the men and youths were inhumanly
butchered, to the number of 1700, and the women
and children sold into slavery.</p>

<p>Three thousand Zealots, under Judas ben Jair,
who had escaped by one of the subterranean passages
from Jerusalem, were hiding in a wood on the
outskirts of the Jordan. There they were, however,
discovered and surrounded by the Romans, who
mercilessly destroyed them. The death of Bassus,
taking place at this time, caused the difficult task<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
of the conquest of Masada to devolve upon his
successor Silva. This hill-fortress was, if possible,
still more inaccessible than that of Machærus.
The garrison consisted of 1000 Zealots, with their
wives and children, commanded by Eleazer ben
Jair, a descendant of Judas the founder of the
Zealots. They were amply provided with provisions,
water and weapons, and were, moreover,
men of heroic resolve. But a Roman battering-ram
destroyed one of the protecting walls, and a
second wall of wooden beams, built by the besieged,
was set on fire by the assailants. The
situation was a hopeless one. Eleazer realized
this, and determined upon persuading the garrison
to die by their own hands rather than to fall into
the power of the Romans. The heroes agreed to
this proposal, even with enthusiasm, and on the
first day of the great Feast of Passover, after
slaying their wives and children, they all perished
on their own swords. When the Romans entered
the citadel, prepared for the last desperate struggle
with their victims, they stood amazed at the ominous
silence, and their shouts brought forth only two
trembling women and five children, who came
creeping out from a cavern. And it was thus that
the last Zealots fell on Judæan ground.</p>

<p>The Judæans who had tried to shake off the
Roman yoke had, indeed, been severely punished.
Not only the inhabitants of Judæa, but also the
Judæan community in Rome were made answerable
for the rebellion. The two drachmæ which they
had annually given to their Sanctuary were now
demanded for the Capitoline Jupiter. Vespasian's
greed soon caused this tax to be swept into his
private treasury; and this first tax, inaugurated and
imposed by the emperor upon the Judæans, was
called the Judæan fiscal tax (Fiscus Judaicus). On
the other hand, those Judæans who had been friendly
to Rome, and had given Vespasian assistance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
during the war, were richly recompensed. Berenice
was received with the highest honors at the Imperial
court. Titus' passion for this beautiful
woman was so great that once, in a fit of jealousy,
he ordered the strangulation of a Roman Consul,
Cacina, his own table-companion. To flatter his
vanity the Council of the Areopagus, the Six
Hundred and the people of Athens erected a statue
to Berenice, dedicated to "the great Queen,
daughter of the great King, Julius Agrippa."
He was on the eve of making her his wife, when
an indignant outburst from the people of Rome
forced him to let her depart. Her brother Agrippa
shared her fall.</p>

<p>More fortunate was Josephus, whom Vespasian
and Titus could not sufficiently reward for his
services. He accompanied the emperors on their
triumphal processions, looked on the humiliation of
his nation with revolting coldness, and showed
undisguised delight in the death of her heroes.
Vespasian not only granted him extensive landed
possessions, but also placed his private palace at
his disposal, and raised him to the citizenship of
Rome. So high did he stand in the favor of the
imperial house, that he was anxious to adopt their
name, and is known to posterity as "Flavius Josephus."
On the other hand, he was hated by the
Judæan patriots, who exerted themselves to disturb
him in the tranquil enjoyment of his possessions.</p>

<p>But the war against the Zealots did not terminate
with the fall of the last fortress. They transplanted
their hatred of Rome whithersoever their flying feet
carried them&mdash;to the provinces of the Euphrates, to
Arabia, Egypt, and Cyrene. The Zealots who had
taken refuge in Alexandria persuaded their co-religionists
of that city to revolt against their rulers.
Many of the Alexandrian Judæans, still smarting
from the severe persecutions which they had suffered
some years previously from the Romans, were ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
for revolt; but this mad scheme was opposed by the
wealthy members of the community and the Council.
They turned indignantly upon the Zealots, delivering
six hundred into the hands of the governor,
Lupus, who executed them upon the spot. Others
fled to Thebes, where they were pursued, seized,
and put to the torture to make them acknowledge
the emperor's authority. But unflinchingly they
bore the most horrible agonies, men and boys
vying with each other in steadfast adherence to
their Zealot principles, and dying at last under
torture. Vespasian, fearing that Egypt might
become a new center of revolt, ordered the Temple
of Onias to be closed, thus taking from the people
their religious focus. The annual gifts, dedicated to
the service of the Sanctuary, found their way, as a
matter of course, into the imperial treasury.</p>

<p>Some of the Zealots who had fled to the towns of
Cyrenaica, now attempted to endanger their peace.
Jonathan, one of their number, collected a multitude
of the lower classes about him, and leading
them into the Lybian Desert, announced some
miraculous interposition. But here, again, the chief
Judæans denounced their fanatical brethren to Catullus,
the Roman governor, who seized them, and
had many of them executed. Jonathan, however,
evaded their pursuit for some time, and at last,
when captured, revenged himself by accusing many
of the wealthy Judæans of being his accomplices.
He was thrown into chains and sent to Rome. In
the imperial city he ventured to declare that
Josephus and some of the Roman Judæans were
disloyal to the emperor. Titus indignantly refused
to believe this, and appeared to defend his favorite,
whose innocence, together with that of his co-religionists,
he clearly established. Jonathan was then
scourged and burnt alive.</p>

<p>Thus ended the Zealot movement which had
spread with evil results among a large portion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
the Judæan people in the Roman Empire. But
the Zealots who had escaped to North Arabia to
the vicinity of Medina were the most fortunate; for
they succeeded in founding a community of their
own, which lasted until the seventh century. Upon
another occasion, they played no unimportant part.</p>

<p>So great was the sensation produced throughout
the Roman Empire by this long and desperate
resistance of the Judæans, that several writers felt
themselves called upon to give a detailed description
of the war. The heathen authors were, of
course, partial in their treatment of the subject;
and, with due deference to the feelings of the
Roman generals, underrated the heroism of the
Judæans. But Josephus, who, in spite of his
Roman proclivities, had some spark of patriotism
left, could not brook hearing his people stigmatized
as cowards; so, collecting all the facts of the long
struggle that had come under his own notice, he
wrote an account of the war in seven books, at
first in the Syro-Chaldaic tongue, and afterwards
in Greek (75&ndash;79). But this version could not turn
out to be any more impartial, seeing how deeply
his own interests had been involved. He laid his
work before Titus, who gave him permission to
offer it to the public, a clear proof that the Emperor
was satisfied with its tendency. Justus of Tiberias
had preceded Josephus with a history of the Judæan
war, in which he accused that historian of hostility
to Rome, of having been party to the revolt in
Galilee, and of having invented his descent from the
Hasmonæan house.</p>

<p>When the war of the sword was at an end, the
war of the pen was carried on by the two writers.
But Justus can hardly be commended for exemplary
conduct; for he had once led a revolt in
Galilee, and had then headed a sally against the
neighboring Greek population; after which he presented
himself boldly before Agrippa. Berenice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
having obtained his pardon, he was taken into the
king's service and most generously treated. But
for some later offense he was imprisoned, and banished,
then recalled, pardoned, and made the king's
secretary. He was at length banished again for
some unknown reason. Justus, having received a
thoroughly Greek education, was able to write the
history of the war in a more correct and elegant
style than it was possible for Josephus to do.</p>

<p>Jeremiah, uttering his lamentations amidst the
ruins of Jerusalem, fitly ends the first period of
Jewish history; whilst Flavius Josephus, writing
the story of his people in the quiet of Cæsar's
palace, concludes the second period.</p>

<p>The disastrous result of the war which had been
waged against the Romans during a period of four
years, the destruction of the State, the burning
of the Temple, the condemnation of the prisoners
to labor in the lead-works of Egypt, to be sold in
the slave-markets, or to become victims in the
fights with wild beasts in the arena&mdash;all these
calamities came with such crushing force on the
remaining Jews that they felt utterly at a loss as to
what they should do. Judæa was depopulated; all
who had taken up arms, whether in northern or
southern, whether in cis- or trans-Jordanic Judæa,
were either dead or enslaved and banished. The
infuriated conquerors had spared neither the women
nor the children. The third banishment&mdash;the Roman
Exile (Galut Edom), under Vespasian and Titus&mdash;had
commenced amid greater terror and cruelty
than the Babylonian Exile under Nebuchadnezzar.
Only a few were spared&mdash;those who openly or
secretly sided with the Romans, partisans of Rome,
who, from the very commencement, had been
devoid of patriotic feelings; the friends of peace,
who thought that Judaism had a different task
from that of combating the Romans by force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
of arms, thoughtful and careful men, who looked
upon a contest with Rome as national suicide;
and lastly those who, through party strife, had
been forced to lay down their arms and to make
separate terms with the Romans. This small
remnant in the land of Judæa and the Jews of
Syria, who had always hoped that Titus would
respect the Temple (the center of worship and
religion), were moved deeply, and thrown into
despair at the destruction of the sanctuary protected
by God. Their despair led to various
results. Some were driven to lead an ascetic
life, to deny themselves meat and wine; others
were led thereby to join Christianity, seeking thus
to fill the void in their hearts which was caused by
the cessation of burnt-offerings. Judaism was
threatened by the greatest danger; deprived, as
it was, of its support and rallying-point, it appeared
in imminent danger of stagnation or of falling to
pieces. The communities in Syria, Babylon, and
Persia, in Asia Minor, Rome, and in Europe generally,
had until now turned their eyes to Jerusalem
and the Temple, whence they drew their instructions
and laws. The only independent congregation,
that of Alexandria, had become helpless through the
destruction of the Temple of Onias. What was to
be the future of the Jewish nation, of Judaism?
The Synhedrion, which had given laws to the entire
community, and had regulated its religious life, had
disappeared with the fall of Jerusalem. Who would
step into the breach, and render a continued existence
a possibility? There now appeared a man
who seemed made to save the essential doctrines
of Judaism, to restore some amount of strength to
the nation, so that it might continue to live, and the
threatened decay be averted.</p>

<p>This man was Jochanan, the son of Zakkai. He
labored, like the prophets during the first exile in
Babylon, but by other means, to maintain the life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
of the Jewish nation; he reanimated its frozen limbs,
and infusing fresh energy into its actions, consolidated
its dispersed members into one whole. Jochanan,
if not a disciple of Hillel, was yet an heir to
his mind. For forty years he is said to have been
a tradesman. In other cases, too, we shall see
that the great leaders in Jewish history did not
follow the study of the Law as a means of subsistence
or of gain. During the existence of the
State, Jochanan sat in the Synhedrion, or taught
within the shadow of the Temple: his school at
Jerusalem is said to have been an important one.
He was the first man who successfully combated
the Sadducees, and who knew how to refute their
arguments. During the stormy days of the revolution,
he, owing to his peaceful character, joined
the party of peace, and on several occasions he
urged the nation and the Zealots to surrender the
town of Jerusalem, and to submit to the Romans.
"Why do you desire to destroy the town, and to give
up the Temple to the flames?" he would say to the
leaders of the revolution.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the respect in which he was
held, his well-meant admonitions were ignored by
the Zealots. The spies whom the Roman general
placed in the besieged city of Jerusalem, and who
reported to him what took place, did not fail to
announce that Jochanan belonged to the friends of
Rome, and that he counseled the chiefs to make
peace. The news from the town was conveyed on
small pieces of paper, which were shot on arrows
into the Roman camp. Induced either by fear of the
Zealots, or by the desire of obtaining a place of
safety for the Law, Jochanan formed the idea of
taking refuge in the camp of Titus. To depart
from the town was, however, very difficult, as the
Zealots kept up a constant watch; Jochanan, therefore,
aided by a leader of the Zealots, named
Ben-Batiach, determined to have himself conveyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
out of the town as a corpse. Having been placed
in a coffin he was carried out of the city gates, at the
hour of sunset, by his pupils Eleazer and Joshua.
Titus received the fugitive in a friendly manner,
and gave him permission to make some request of
him. Jochanan modestly requested that he might
be permitted to establish a school at Jamnia (Jabne),
where he could give lectures to his pupils. The
district in which this town lay belonged to the
private domains of the imperial house, to which it had
been bequeathed by the last will of Salome, the sister
of Herod. Titus had nothing to urge against the
harmless wish of Jochanan, for he could not foresee
that by this unimportant concession he was enabling
Judaism, feeble as it then appeared, to outlive
Rome, which was in all its vigor, by thousands of
years.</p>

<p>Jochanan settled with his disciples in Jamnia,
a city not far from the Mediterranean Sea, and
situated between the port Joppa, and the former
city of the Philistines, Ashdod. Jochanan was
unable to settle down to his occupation for some
space of time, during which the bitter strife was
raging before the walls of Jerusalem, and within its
streets and its Temple. When the news arrived
that the city had fallen, and that the Temple was
in flames, Jochanan and his disciples mourned and
wailed as if they had lost a dear relative through
death. Jochanan, however, unlike his followers, did
not despair, for he recognized the truth that Judaism
was not indissolubly bound up with its Temple and
its altar. He rather consoled his mourning disciples
for the loss of the place of expiation with the
fitting remark that charity and love of mankind
would take the place of burnt-offerings, as it is
said in the Bible&mdash;"for I take pleasure in mercy
and not in burnt-offerings." This liberal view of the
value of burnt-offerings made it clear, however, that
it was absolutely necessary for a fresh center to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
established in lieu of the Temple. Jochanan therefore
formed a sort of Synhedrion in Jabne, of which
he was at once recognized as the President. The
newly created Synhedrion was certainly not composed
of seventy members, and no doubt had a
totally different sphere of action from the one in
Jerusalem, which during the revolution had exercised
control over the most important political
events. The Synhedrion of Jamnia in the first
place gave to its founder plenary power in all religious
matters such as the Council had possessed in
Jerusalem, and with this were connected the judicial
functions of a supreme court. It was only by
unbounded authority that Jochanan could compass
the formation and consolidation of a Synhedrion,
under the unfavorable conditions of the time.
Jochanan had to oppose the general opinion that
the Synhedrion as a body should have control only
in the hewn-stone hall of the Temple, and that
outside this spot it lost its judicial character and
ceased to be the representative of the nation.
When, therefore, Jochanan dissociated the functions
of the Synhedrion from the site of the Temple, and
removed it to Jabne, he had actually released Judaism
from the observance of the rite of burnt-offerings,
and rendered it independent. Without
any opposition whatsoever, Jabne by this means
took the place of Jerusalem, and became the religious
national center for the dispersed community.
The important functions of the Synhedrion, by
which it exercised a judicial and uniting power over
the distant congregations, such as the fixing of the
time for the new moon and the festivals, proceeded
from Jabne. It enjoyed some of the religious
privileges of the Holy City. The Synhedrion now
bore the name of the Beth-Din (Court of Justice)&mdash;the
President was called Rosh-beth-din, and was
honored by the title of Rabban (general teacher).
Jochanan gave over to the Court of Justice the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
supervision of arrangements for the calendar,
which had formerly been one of the offices of the
President. By this means the watchers who were
looking out for the reappearance of the new moon
needed no longer follow the President about in order
to give him the information, but had only to attend
the sittings of the assembly. This change was an
important step, as it rendered the Synhedrion independent
of the person of its President.</p>

<p>Jochanan made altogether nine changes, most
of which affected such arrangements as had been
rendered valueless through the destruction of the
Temple. He, however, retained various religious
customs as a remembrance of the Temple. He
promoted the continuance and preservation of
Judaism through the renewal of the study of the
Law, and thus rendered firmer the weakened
foundations of Jewish communal life. The school
at Jabne he influenced through his disciples, whom
he imbued with his spirit and his learning. Five
of his distinguished pupils are known to us by
name, but only three of them won lasting renown&mdash;Eliezer,
and Joshua (who had carried Jochanan in
a coffin out of Jerusalem), and also Eleazer ben
Arach. The latter was the most eminent and important
amongst them, and of him it was said, "If
weighed in the scale, he would outweigh all his
fellow-scholars." Jochanan loved to incite them to
independent thought by deep-reaching questions.
Thus he gave them as a theme for thought, "What
should man endeavor most eagerly to obtain?"
The one answered "a genial manner," the other
"a noble friend," a third "a noble neighbor," the
fourth "the gift of knowing in advance the result
of his actions." Eleazer answered that "man's
best possession is a noble heart." This remark
won the approval of his master; it was an answer
after his own mind, for in it all else was included.</p>

<p>What was the character of the teachings which
Jochanan imparted to his pupils in the school?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
Hillel, the most respected of the teachers of the
Law, the highly-honored ideal in times to come,
had given to Judaism a special garb and form, or
rather had given it the character of the Law, which
had always been peculiar to it. He was the first to
develop and confirm a special theory, a sort of
Jewish theology or nomology (science of religious
laws). He was the founder of Talmudic Judaism.
From the midst of contending parties, which were
tearing one another to pieces, Hillel had drawn the
Law into the quiet precincts of the school-house,
and had endeavored to bring into harmony those
precepts which were apparently opposed to the
Law. Those which had been considered as only
customary and traditional were regarded as human
laws, and were looked upon by the Sadducees as
innovations. Hillel had shown these to be of Biblical
origin. His seven explanatory rules, or laws of
interpretation, had on the one hand confirmed the
laws which had been introduced by the Sopheric
and Pharisaic teachers, and on the other hand had
given them new scope to develop.</p>

<p>The written Law (that of the Pentateuch) and
the oral Law (the Sopheric) from his time ceased
to be two widely sundered branches, but were
brought into close relations with each other, although
the new rendering certainly did violence to
the words of Scripture. But as the text was explained,
not on a philological basis, but in order
to elucidate the laws, it was not possible to keep
simply to the written words; it was necessary to interpret
them so as to render them suited to the new
conditions of life. Under the term Oral Law was
included everything which had been handed down
from the Fathers, and it formed to a certain extent a
hereditary law. The various restrictions which the
Sopheric teachers had placed around the Law, the
legal decisions which had been introduced by the
Synhedrion, the customs which had been observed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
from generation to generation, the extensions deduced
from meager verses of the Pentateuch, all
these elements were not written down, but were
committed to memory. They were put into the form
of short sentences, called "Halacha." They were
not arranged or classified according to subjects, but
were strung together without connection, or handed
down separately, sometimes joined to the name of
the authority from whom they were derived. A
marvelous memory was needed to retain these
Halachas or oral teachings. Jochanan ben Zakkai
was the man who best knew these laws. He
handed them down to his pupils, and pointed out
to them their connection with the written law; he
showed them how to draw deductions therefrom,
the laws handed down being the material, and their
mode of treatment the form. These deductions
were obtained by two methods, the one showing
how the ordinances of the Law were to be obtained
from the words of Scripture (Midrash), and the other
served to apply the oral Law to new questions as
they arose (Talmud). Thus a fruitful field for the
extension of the Law and for ingenious combinations
was opened, which was later on freely cultivated.
Jochanan ben Zakkai, however, thought
much more of the material of the Law than of its
form.</p>

<p>He taught not only those doctrines of Judaism
which appertained to the Law, but also those portions
of the Holy Scriptures which had no direct
bearing on the Law. He gave lectures on the
writings of the prophets and historians in the form of
discourses, which had for some time past been in use
both in and out of the synagogue. These lectures
were either edifying, comforting, or bitter, sharp,
and ironical, and applied the words of the prophets
about Edom and Esau, to hated Rome and its
tyranny. This kind of exposition of Scripture
had a name, "Agada" or "Hagadah." Its chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
subjects consisted in explaining historical events,
prophetic utterances, and in bringing to mind the
past, and treating of the future of Judaism. The
Agada investigated the meaning of the Law, examined
into the general moral truths of Judaism,
deftly united the present with the past, and shadowed
the present conditions of life in past experiences.
The Halacha forms the chief trunk of
the Law, the Midrash the suckling roots, which
drew their nourishment from the words of Scripture.
The Talmud formed the wide-spreading branches,
and the Agada was the blossom which scented and
colored the simple fabric of the laws.</p>

<p>In his Agadic dissertations Jochanan endeavored
to illuminate the ordinances of the Law by the light
of the understanding, and to combine them into
general truths, but in a clear and simple manner,
utterly dissimilar from the exaggerated method of
the Alexandrian-Jewish teachers, who endeavored
to extract the dazzling light of the Grecian mode
of thought from Holy Writ.</p>

<p>Amongst other things, Jochanan explained very
quaintly why the use of iron is forbidden in erecting
an altar. Iron is the symbol of war and dissension;
the altar, on the contrary, is the symbol of peace and
atonement; therefore iron must be kept away from
the altar. He deduced therefrom the high value of
peace, the advantages of peace between man and
wife, between one city and another, and between
one nation and another. These were the principles
which had induced him to side with the Romans
against the revolutionaries. In this way he explained
various laws, and rendered them comprehensible,
when they seemed obscure or in any way
extraordinary. Jochanan was wont to hold converse
also with Pagans who had knowledge of the Jewish
Law, either from the Greek translation or from their
intercourse with the Jews, refuting the objections
which they raised, and dispelling or making clear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
by suitable comparisons the peculiarities which occur
in the Holy Writings.</p>

<p>Besides Jochanan, who was the most influential and
the chief personage of his time, there was a group of
teachers of the Law. They were all at an advanced
age at the period of the destruction of the State,
and were without doubt members of the Jamnian
Synhedrion. Most of them, of whom nothing important
is recorded, are known only by name.
Among these were Chanina, the deputy of various
High Priests (<i xml:lang="he" lang="he">Segan ha-Cohanim</i>), who has preserved
for us traditions from the time of the Temple.
He belonged to the lovers of peace, and exhorted
his contemporaries to pray for the well-being of the
ruling power (that of the Romans), "for, if no fear
thereof existed, then one man would swallow another
alive." Zadok, another teacher, was a disciple of
Shammai, and in anticipation of the fall of the Temple
he fasted for forty years, whereby he ruined his
health. Nachum, the Mede, who had been previously
member of a college of the Law in Jerusalem,
Dossa ben Archinas, with his brother Jonathan,
the latter a clear-headed and argumentative
youth, and Abba Saul must also be mentioned.</p>

<p>Lastly, there belonged to this circle Nachum of
Gimso (Emmaus), and Nechunya ben Hakana. The
first has been recorded by tradition as the hero of
strange adventures, and even the name of his birthplace
Gimso has been explained, so as to put into
his mouth the words "This also is for good" (Gam-su-l'-toba).
He is represented in the world of
legend as a scholar to whom many disagreeable experiences
happened, all of which proved of good
to him. Nachum developed a special mode of
teaching, which consisted in explaining the oral law
from the written text, according to certain particles
which the lawgiver had purposely used as indications
when drawing up the Law. These particles,
according to his idea, not only served as syntactical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
signs in the sentences, but as signs for enlarging
and diminishing the circle within which each law
should work. Nachum's rules formed a new and
fruitful addition to those laid down by Hillel; they
were carefully cultivated and developed, and received
the name "the rules of extension or exclusion"
(Ribbuj-u-m'ut). Nechunya ben Hakana was,
however, an opponent of Nachum's system; he approved
only the explanatory rules as propounded
by Hillel.</p>

<p>Jochanan ben Zakkai, the head not of the State
but of the community, appears to have acted as a
shield from a political point of view. His kindly
and gentle disposition, in which he resembled Hillel,
he displayed even to the heathens. It is related of
him that he always greeted them in a friendly manner.
Such friendliness offers a striking contrast to
the hatred felt by the Zealots towards the heathens,
both before and after the revolution, which increased
after the destruction of the Temple. The
verse (Proverbs xiv. 34), "The kindness of the
nations is sin," was taken literally by the people of
that time, and was specially applied to the heathen
world. "The heathens may do ever so much good,
yet it is accounted to them as sin, for they do it
only to mock us." Jochanan alone explained this
verse in a sense expressive of true humanity: "As
the burnt-offering atones for Israel, so mercy and
kindness atone for the heathen nations." This
kindliness of Jochanan may have contributed to the
result that, notwithstanding the fresh outbreaks
amongst the Jews in Cyrene and Egypt, which the
Emperors Vespasian and Titus had to put down,
they did not persecute the Jews in any extraordinary
degree. It is expressly stated in ancient
records that the Roman authorities removed the
contempt which formerly attached to the Jews, and
that the murder of a Jew was punished by death.
The personality of Jochanan may have served them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
as a guarantee for the peaceful disposition of the
mother-country.</p>

<p>Hope alone gave to him and his circle of fellow-pupils
and disciples fresh courage, the hope or rather
the assurance that Israel should not be lost. The
dreary present did not veil from him the promised
and brighter future. The present was in truth
sufficiently overcast. The pasture lands had been
taken away from those who had survived the national
disasters, and given to strangers. Thereby those
who had formerly been rich had fallen into poverty.
The very poorest had to pay the Jews' tax (Fiscus
Judaicus). The land, which before the war had
been so flourishing, was strewn with ruins. Every
joy had departed from Israel; even weddings were
performed in a silent manner. Jochanan described
the comfortless position of the times in an address
to the people. He once saw a Jewish maiden of a
rich house, picking up a scanty nourishment of
barley-corn from amongst the horses' hoofs. At
this he exclaimed, "Unhappy nation, you would not
serve God, and therefore you must serve foreign
nations; you would not offer half a shekel for the
Temple, and therefore you must pay thirty times as
much to the State of your new enemies; you refused
to keep the roads and paths in order for the pilgrims,
and, therefore, you must now support the
watch-lodges in the vineyards, which the Romans
have seized."</p>

<p>Agrippa and Berenice, the remaining members
of the house of Herod, who kept up close connections
with those in power, appear to have contributed
greatly to the alleviation of the sorrows of
the conquered Jews. Princess Berenice, whose
beauty seemed to bid defiance to time, long held
Titus captive by her charms, and it wanted but
little for the Jewish princess to become a Roman
empress. The prejudice of Roman pride disturbed
the project of a marriage between Titus and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
Berenice, and compelled the Emperor's son to
break the bonds which had bound him for years.
Berenice had to leave the royal palace, and probably
returned to her brother in Palestine. But as
Titus had not yet given up the hope of making her
his wife, her voice still had weight with him, and it
probably was often raised in favor of her co-religionists,
to whom she was attached. The last
Jewish king, Agrippa, also stood in favor with
Vespasian, for the great services which he had
rendered to his house. It appears that the Emperor
had added Galilee to his territories; Agrippa
had a Jewish governor, whom he sent alternately to
the two Galilæan capitals, Tiberias and Sepphoris.
To this ruler it was no doubt due that the district
of Galilee recovered itself more rapidly, and became
sooner repeopled than Judæa, which was governed
by a Roman ruler.</p>

<p>The period during which Jochanan worked in his
new sphere of action cannot be stated with certainty.
He united in himself the qualities of the
prophet Jeremiah and the prince Zerubbabel, who had
been in exile. Like Jeremiah he mourned over the
destruction of Jerusalem, and like Zerubbabel he
unrolled a new future. Both Jochanan ben Zakkai
and Zerubbabel stood at the threshold of a new
epoch, both laid the foundation-stone of a new
edifice in Judaism, for the completion of which
the subsequent generations have worked. Jochanan
died on his bed in the arms of his pupils. He
had previously had a conversation with them, which
gives an insight into his mind. His pupils were surprised
to find their courageous master frightened
and depressed in the hour of his death. He remarked
that he did not fear death, but the having
to appear before the Eternal Ruler, whose justice
was incorruptible. He blessed his pupils before his
death with these words&mdash;"May the fear of God
influence your actions as much as the fear of man."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
Immediately after the death of their master, his
chief disciples held council as to the place where
they might continue the work of teaching the Law.
Most of them thought of remaining in Jabne, where
there lived a circle of men acquainted with the
traditions of the past. Eleazar ben Arach, the
favorite pupil of Jochanan, however, insisted on
removing the school to Emmaus (Gimso), a healthy
and pleasant town, three geographical miles distant
from Jabne. Believing that he was absolutely needful
to his fellow-students, and being persuaded by
his wife that they would soon follow him, he separated
from them, and remained in Emmaus. Solitary
and cut off from the opportunity of exchanging
ideas with others, he is said to have so utterly forgotten
what he once knew, that amusing anecdotes
are related of his subsequent ignorance. To Arach
was applied the saying, "Repair to the place of the
Law, and do not fancy that thy comrades will follow
thee, and that they can uphold the Law only through
thee; do not rely too much on thy penetration."
Whilst Arach, from whom so much was hoped, was
thus forgotten, his companions continued the work of
their master, and became renowned in generations
to come. Gamaliel, Joshua, and Eliezer came to the
fore as important personages.</p>

<p>It was first necessary to give a chief to the community,
which, though small, was yet respected by
the Jews of all countries. Gamaliel was chosen;
he was the descendant of Hillel, and his ancestors
had presided over the Synhedrion throughout four
generations. It must have been necessary to remove
political difficulties to enable the son of the man
who had been concerned in the uprising against the
Romans, to attain so high a rank. Gamaliel took
the title Nasi (Prince&mdash;among the Romans, Patriarch).
He had his seat in Jabne, and was also
sufficiently versed in traditions to preside in the
school. Although the town of Jabne was of first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
importance, the members of the new college established
some schools outside of the town of Jabne,
but in its neighborhood. Eliezer taught at Lydda;
Joshua at Bekiin, on the plains between Jabne
and Lydda; other pupils of Jochanan also opened
schools; and each attracted a circle of disciples,
and was called by the title Rabbi (Master). The
Patriarch was called Rabban (General Master), to
distinguish him from the other teachers. The Law
therefore was not left unheeded after the death of
the founder of the Jabne Synhedrion; it received,
if possible, even more attention; but the unity which
had hardly been established threatened to disappear
altogether. The disputes between the adherents
of the schools of Hillel and Shammai, over
which blood had been shed before the destruction
of the Temple, and which had only been quelled by
the war of the revolution, broke out afresh, and the
more severely, as the uniting influence proceeding
from the Temple now no longer existed. The contentions
between the schools, which extended to
various practical matters, brought about wide divergence
in the views with regard to the Law and life.
One teacher held some things to be permissible
which another forbade; and in one place things
were done which were not allowed in another. Thus
Judaism seemed to have two bodies of laws, or,
according to the words of the Talmud&mdash;"The one
Law had become two." Important questions of
life, sometimes involving serious consequences, such
as those concerning marriage, were affected by these
differences. The younger generation, relieved from
the necessity for mutual forbearance occasioned by
the late war, had no very strong desire to make
peace, but contested the disputed questions with
great acrimony. The endeavor to terminate these
quarrels, which threatened the destruction of all
unity, was the life-task of Gamaliel, but his policy
brought him into open collision with his friends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
Little is known of his private affairs, but this little
shows him to have possessed a high moral character
and a powerful mind. Gamaliel owned land, which
he lent to be cultivated on condition that he received
a part of the harvest. He also gave corn for sowing
purposes, but when he was repaid he only accepted
the lowest prices, in order to avoid even the appearance
of taking interest. He displayed great
tenderness to his favorite slave Tabi, whom he would
willingly have set free could he have done so, and
had not the Law disapproved of manumission. On
the death of the slave he mourned for him as for a
relative. Gamaliel appears to have had some mathematical
knowledge. In fixing the new moon and
the holidays dependent on it, he was guided more
by astronomical calculations than by the evidence
of witnesses that they had or had not seen the new
moon. Such reckonings, exact even to a fraction,
were handed down in the house of the Patriarch.
Gamaliel often made journeys in order to visit the
various congregations, to be an eye-witness of their
condition, and to keep them all in order. His journeys
took him over Judæa, into Galilee, and as far
as Acco (Ptolemais). Although he was not of robust
health, he did not spare himself the greatest exertions,
when he could benefit his people. His rule
as Patriarch occurred in a very troubled time, both
within and without, and this circumstance caused him
to insist on his dignity most strictly. His character
was thereby misunderstood, and he was accused
of forming selfish and ambitious plans. Gamaliel
directed his chief energies to raise the patriarchal
dignity that it should become the center of the
Jewish community, so as to maintain by his authority
the threatened unity of the Law, and the religious
and moral condition of the people. In the contests
between the disciples of the schools of Shammai and
Hillel he decreed that votes should be taken with
regard to each law in question, and that the decision<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
should be determined by the majority of votes in the
college, in order to protect by authority the threatened
unity of the Law against all attacks. The desire for
unity seems to have been more generally felt, the
more the opposition between the two schools increased,
and the more the two sets of followers,
who clung to the Halachas bequeathed to them by
their teachers, sought to develop their doctrines.
Contemporaries did not disguise from themselves
the fact that the Law might easily be subject to
confusion through these differences. A fear was
expressed that the time would soon come when
men would refer in vain to the Holy Writings or to
the Oral Law for a decision, and when one account
would contradict the other. The Synhedrion of
Jabne, therefore, once more subjected contested
matters to discussion and decision. It began with
the fundamental propositions of Hillel and Shammai,
in order to fix by voting such rules as should
hold good in all cases. But it was not easy to
obtain unity; for three and a half years the contest
is said to have lasted in the vineyards of Jabne,
both parties insisting on the exclusive correctness
of their own traditions&mdash;the Shammaites being
especially stubborn and immovable, and, like the
founder of their school, not disposed to yield. Then
a voice, heard by chance (Bath-Kol), which was
usually considered as a communication from heaven
in difficult cases, is said to have sounded through
the school-house in Jabne&mdash;a voice which said,
"The teachings of both schools are the words of
the living God, but practically the laws of Hillel
only are to carry weight." Joshua, a man of calm
disposition, alone expressed himself against any
decision arrived at by the Bath-Kol. "We do not
require a miraculous voice," he said, "for the Law is
not given for heavenly beings, but for men, who in
questionable cases can decide by taking a majority,
and a miracle cannot in such cases give the decision."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
Eliezer also was not satisfied with the conclusion
arrived at, but this opposition had only slight results.
Hillel's expositions, deductions, and explanatory
rules at length attained the authority due to them.
As the followers of Shammai held with the Zealots,
the enemies of the Romans, and the Hillelites with
the peace party, the revolution was in some measure
ended by this act of the Synhedrion of Jabne. But
it was not intended to exercise compulsion against
the Shammaites, and so entirely to reorganize their
religious life according to the decision arrived at;
on the contrary it permitted them to follow their
own convictions. "Every man according to his
choice may follow the school of Hillel or of Shammai,
but the decisions of the school of Hillel shall be the
only accepted interpretation of the Law." Rabbi
Gamaliel watched most carefully over the union
of the two parties, which was probably his work,
and withstood any attempt to oppose the decisions
of the Synhedrion; he was supported by the venerable
Zadok, to whom he gave the place of honor at
his right hand at all meetings, and who, having
beheld the Temple in its glory, was considered as
an authority.</p>

<p>There seems to have been another regulation in
use besides the above, but the connection of the
two is not very clear. The Patriarch of Jabne made
a rule that only such persons should be admitted
to the school-house whose uprightness had been
proved; and for this purpose he placed a porter at
the doors of the school, in order to prevent the
admission of those who were unworthy. It appears
that he desired to exclude such as pursued
the study of the Law with wrong intentions; some,
perhaps, had sought admission to the school from
vanity or other ignoble motives. Two warnings,
the one by Jochanan ben Zakkai, and the other by
Zadok, against those who took part in the study of
the Law from self-interest, appear to confirm this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
supposition. The former said, "If you have acquired
much of the Law, do not be proud of it, for you are
made for that purpose." The latter said, "Do not
use the Law as a crown in order to shine with it,
nor as a spade in order to dig with it." Such low
ideas Gamaliel endeavored to keep out of the circle
of the school.</p>

<p>Both arrangements, the employment of the authority
of the Patriarch in maintaining the Halachic
decisions, and the precautions for admitting members
and disciples, met with opposition, which at
first was only timidly expressed. The Patriarch
endeavored to keep down contests by the use of
excommunication, which he employed with great
energy, and with that entire disregard of consequences
which arises from deeply rooted conviction.
The excommunication (Nidui) had not at that time
the gloomy severity of later ages, but was of a mild
form; forbidding the interdicted man to hold any
close intercourse with others until he had penitently
submitted to the required demands. During the
interdict, which lasted at least thirty days, the sinner
wore a black mourning-garb and kept several
mourning observances; if he died during this period
without having submitted or repented, the Court of
Justice had a stone laid on his coffin. Gamaliel had
the courage to excommunicate several of the most
important personages of his time, whereby he made
many bitter enemies. He acted thus even towards
his own brother-in-law, Eliezer ben Hyrcanus.
Deeply impressed by the unfortunate results which
disunion must bring to Judaism, threatened as it
already was by various half-Jewish, half-Christian
sects, Gamaliel did not hesitate to proceed with
severity against trifling offenses, in order to avoid
the destruction of religious unity. There was once
a discussion about an oven of peculiar structure,
which a decision of the majority had pronounced
liable to become unclean, like earthenware<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
vessels. Eliezer, following a special tradition,
did not wish to yield to this decision, and acted in
opposition to it; at Gamaliel's instigation, Eliezer
was excommunicated.</p>

<p>Gamaliel thought that he had united the two
schools, and had brought about peace, when his
power was destroyed by a man from whom he
had not expected any energetic opposition. Joshua,
who was of a yielding disposition, and apparently
the least dangerous of the opponents of the severe
Patriarch, became his worst enemy. Joshua was
just as discontented with some of Gamaliel's regulations
as Eliezer had been, but he did not venture
to show his disapproval on account of his poor and
miserable condition, and when he happened to utter
any contradictory opinion he quickly withdrew it
again. Gamaliel had received the report of two untrustworthy
witnesses in order to fix the commencement
of the month of Tishri, on which depended
the dates of the chief festivals, including the Day
of Atonement. Joshua showed that the Patriarch
had committed an error in this act, and demanded
that the college should change the date of the holiday.
Gamaliel remained firm, and sent an order to
Joshua that on the day which, according to Joshua's
calculation, was the Day of Atonement, the latter
should appear before him in workaday clothes, with
his staff, knapsack, and money-bag. This dictatorial
proceeding seemed so harsh to Joshua, that he complained
of it to his most important colleagues, and
appeared determined to oppose it. Those, however,
who saw the necessity for unity persuaded him to
yield. The venerable Dossa ben Harchinas convinced
him that the arrangements of a religious chief
must be uncontested even if they are erroneous,
and that every man must follow them. Joshua
allowed himself to be persuaded, and submitted to
the Patriarch. His appearance filled Gamaliel with
astonishment. He greeted him heartily, and said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
to him, "Welcome, my teacher and pupil&mdash;my
teacher in wisdom, my pupil in obedience. Happy
is the age in which great men obey inferior ones."
But this reconciliation was not of long duration.
The severe proceedings of the Patriarch had raised
a hostile party against him, which began secretly
to act in opposition to him. He knew of this opposition
party, and referred to it in public addresses.
It is related of him that his mode of opening the
sittings of the Synhedrion varied. If none of his
opponents were present he would ask the assembly
to propound questions; if, however, any of his
enemies were present he would not give this invitation.
The opposition party seem therefore to have
put him in a dilemma at these meetings. Gamaliel
may have had reason to consider Joshua as the
chief of this party, and often made him feel the
power of his own higher position by offensive
demeanor and severe treatment. One day the
mutual ill-feeling led to an outbreak, and caused a
change in the Synhedrion. The Patriarch had once
again offended Joshua by his severe manner, and
accused him of secret opposition to one of the
Halachas. As Joshua at first denied the fact,
Gamaliel was so angered that he cried out, "Then
stand, so that witnesses may give evidence against
you." This was the form of an indictment. The
school-house was full of people, amongst whom
there arose a tumult at this contemptuous treatment
of a member who was respected and loved by the
people. The opposition party took courage, and
gave utterance to their dissatisfaction. They called
out to the Patriarch, "Who is there that has not
constantly felt thy severity?" The school was
turned into a tribunal, and the college deposed
Gamaliel on the spot from the dignity of Patriarch.
With his fall ended the regulations made by him.
The porter was removed from the door of the
school, to which all could now gain unobstructed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
admission. The members of the Synhedrion immediately
sought for another Patriarch, so that this
important office might not be unoccupied. They had
too much tact to heap fresh contumely on the late
Patriarch by choosing Joshua, his chief opponent,
and Eliezer, who had a claim to the honor, lay under
an interdict. Akiba seemed fitted for the post by
his intellect and character. He had quickly risen
from ignorance and poverty, had rapidly passed the
intervening steps between the degrees of pupil and
master, and had obtained admiration even from the
profoundest teachers of the Law. But his greatness
was only of yesterday; he had no distinguished
ancestors to show that he was worthy of the dignity
of Patriarch. The college therefore chose a very
young member, Eleazar ben Azariah, who at that
time must have been only in his sixteenth year.
The choice was made on account of his noble
descent from a long line of ancestors, which reached
to Ezra, the regenerator of Judaism, a further motive
for his election being his immense riches and the
consideration in which he was held by the Roman
authorities. Eleazar was not wanting in character
and understanding, and was therefore considered
worthy to succeed Gamaliel.</p>

<p>This deposition and election had great results,
and the day on which these events took place was
considered of such importance by after-comers that
it was known by the simple designation, "that day."
It seems that the college of the Synhedrion, perhaps
on the suggestion of Joshua, again revised those
laws which, through the influence of Gamaliel, had
been decided according to the spirit of the school
of Hillel. The college, which at that time consisted
of the extraordinary number of seventy-two members,
therefore undertook the revision of one-sided
laws, and examined those who were in possession
of traditions. More than twenty persons are
recorded to have given testimony before the college<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
as to the traditions which had been handed
down. In many points the majority of the college
took middle ground between the opposing doctrines
of the schools of Shammai and Hillel, and they
decided "neither like the one nor like the other."
With regard to other contested questions it appeared
that Hillel himself, or his school, had renounced
their own views, and had been inclined to
follow the Shammaites. The witnesses with regard
to the Halachas seem to have been formally examined,
and perhaps their evidence was even written
down. The testimony of witnesses on this day
bears the name Adoyot (evidence of witnesses), or
Bechirta (best choice), and the code drawn up is
without doubt the earliest collection. One recognizes
in its contents the ancient and primitive form
of the traditions. The laws are put together quite
promiscuously, and without any other connection
than the name of the person who handed them
down.</p>

<p>The day of the assembly of witnesses was also of
general importance, on account of two questions
which were discussed. The first question arose
thus. A heathen of Ammonite descent came before
the meeting, asking whether he could be legally
accepted as a proselyte. Gamaliel had turned him
away with the sentence of the written law, "Moabites
and Ammonites may not be received into the
congregation of God, even in the tenth generation."
The disputants treated the question with warmth,
and Gamaliel endeavored to have his view carried.
Joshua, however, carried his view that the sentence
of the Law no longer applied to those times, as,
through the aggressions of their conquerors, all
nations had become mixed together and confused
beyond recognition. The second question concerned
the holiness of the two writings ascribed to King
Solomon, Ecclesiastes (Kohelet), and the Song of
Songs (Shir Hashirim). The school of Shammai<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
had not recognized them as holy. This old contest
was now taken up by the College of Seventy-two,
which had not approved of the decisions of Hillel,
but it is not clearly known with what result. Later
on these Halachas were included in the collection
(Canon) of the Holy Writings, after which the
Canon was completed and several writings in the
Hebrew language were rejected as Apocrypha,
such as the proverbs of Sirach, the first book of the
Maccabees, and several others.</p>

<p>It is a noble characteristic of Gamaliel, which his
contemporaries readily recognized, that notwithstanding
the many insults he received on "that
day," he did not for one moment feel a desire,
from petty revenge, to retire from his office of
teacher. He took part in the discussions as before,
little prospect as there was for him to carry
through his ideas in the midst of an assemblage
which was so opposed to him. But in the eager
controversies of the day he no doubt became convinced
that his great severity had estranged the
others from him, and that he had thereby suppressed
many a true opinion; he felt his courage
broken and he determined to yield. He therefore
went to the most respected members of the Synhedrion,
to apologize for his offensive demeanor.
He visited his chief opponent, Joshua, who was following
his handicraft of needle-making. Gamaliel,
who had grown up in riches, could not suppress his
surprise at seeing so learned a man engaged in
such heavy work, and said, "Is it thus thou makest
thy living?" Joshua took the opportunity frankly
to put before him the indifference shown to the
sad condition of several worthy men&mdash;"It is bad
enough," said Joshua, "that thou hast only just discovered
it. Woe to the age, whose leader thou art,
that thou dost not know of the cares of the learned
and what difficulty they have to support themselves."
Joshua had uttered the same reproach when Gamaliel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
had admired his astronomical knowledge; he
had modestly repudiated his admiration, and pointed
out two pupils who possessed distinguished mathematical
attainments, but who hardly had bread and
clothes. Gamaliel at last besought his enraged
opponent to forgive him, out of consideration for
the highly honored house of Hillel. Joshua thereupon
expressed himself as satisfied, and promised
to work for Gamaliel's reinstatement in the position
of Patriarch. The next step was to induce
the newly-elected Nasi to give up his dignity, upon
which he had only just entered. There was a certain
amount of delicacy in making the suggestion
to him. Akiba, who was ever ready to be of service,
undertook the delicate commission, the execution
of which, however, was not made at all difficult for
him. For hardly had Eleazar, the newly-elected
Patriarch, heard that peace was made between
Gamaliel and his chief enemy, than he was immediately
prepared to return to private life; he even
offered to pay a visit to Gamaliel, attended by the
whole College. The arrangement made between
the Patriarch and Eleazar was that the former should
always preside for the first two weeks, and hold the
classes, and that the latter, as Vice-President, should
do the same in the third week.</p>

<p>In this way the strife ended; it had arisen neither
from ambition nor pride, but only from an erroneous
view of the Patriarch's functions. These disagreements
were soon forgotten, and thenceforward Gamaliel
lived in peace with the members of the Synhedrion.
Perhaps the position of affairs under the
Emperor Domitian had diverted the public attention
from internal matters, and caused the necessity for
union to be felt, in order to avert the dangers which
threatened from without.</p>

<p>Gamaliel represented in this circle of scholars
that desire for unity and authority which might
regulate from one center the entire religious and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
national life of the people. His brother-in-law,
Eliezer, son of Hyrcanus, represented the other
party, namely, those who maintained their own views
and refused to submit to universally binding enactments.
From his earliest youth Eliezer had devoted
himself to the acquirement of Halachas, and these he
impressed so firmly on his memory that, as he himself
said, not a grain of them should be lost. His
teacher, Jochanan, therefore called him "a sealed
cistern which lets no drop pass." It was in accordance
with this method that Eliezer taught at Lydda
(Diospolis), a place which had formerly been a race-course.
When he was questioned as to a law, he
either replied as he had been taught by his teachers,
or openly acknowledged "I do not know; I have
not been told." During his stay once in Cæsarea
Philippi in Upper Galilee, thirty questions were
put to him for decision, to which he replied, "To
twelve of these I can give the decision which has
been handed down to me; for the other eighteen
I have no tradition." Being asked whether he only
taught what had been handed down to him, he
replied, "You compel me now to impart something
which has not been communicated to me; for know
that in my whole life I have never taught a single
word which has not been handed down to me by my
teachers." In order to escape troublesome questions
which he did not know how to answer, he
would put cross-questions from which could be seen
his disinclination to discuss the matter. He was
once asked whether an illegitimate child could succeed
to property, and he asked in return, "Whether
it would be legally considered as a brother." To
the question whether one might paint a house white
after the destruction of the Temple, he put the
cross-question whether one would paint a grave,
thus keeping firm to his rule never to pronounce a
decision which had not been made certain to him by
oral tradition. To the keenest deductions he usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
opposed the simple reply, "I have not heard it." In
order to maintain this peculiar view, he seems to
have impressed on his pupils, "Keep your children
from searching (Higayon); let them rather be
brought up on the knees of the wise."</p>

<p>Eliezer was therefore the conservative element
in the Synhedrion; he was the organ of tradition,
which retained the Halachas precisely as it received
them; he was the "sealed cistern" which
did not permit one drop of water to run away,
nor one fresh drop to find entrance. His contemporaries
and successors gave him the honored
name of "Sinai," a living tablet of the Law,
inscribed with unchangeable precepts. Greatly as
he was respected, however, as a faithful keeper of
the traditional Law, he nevertheless was somewhat
isolated on account of his clinging exclusively to
traditions. His colleagues had gone too far on
the road pointed out by Hillel to be satisfied with
merely keeping the Law; they desired also to extend
and develop it. Eliezer necessarily came into
collision with the tendency of the times. He was
most strongly opposed to his brother-in-law, Gamaliel,
and his method of exclusion in striving for unity.
On the one side was authority supported by a powerful
will, which kept down any revolt against the
law adopted; and on the other side was the secure
knowledge which finds its sanction in the past.
Such opposites could not be easily reconciled, nor
was Eliezer the man to give up his convictions. He
was in fact reproached for his unbending character,
which refused to submit to others, and which made
him express his opinions in harsh terms. The respect
which was felt for him personally made it difficult
to inform him of the fact that he was excommunicated,
but Akiba once more undertook the
office of conveying the unpleasant news. Dressed
in black, he went to Eliezer and gently broke to
him the sentence, and addressed him in these words,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
"It appears to me that thy comrades shun thee."
Eliezer understood the hint, and took the blow
without murmuring; he submitted to the excommunication,
and lived apart from his friends. He took
only a distant interest in the discussions pursued in
Jamnia. When he heard any important decision, he
used to look among the treasures of the Halachas
in order to confirm or dispute it.</p>

<p>Without exercising any influence over affairs
or taking part in the development of the Law,
Eliezer lived his last years in flourishing material
circumstances, but in a dreary state of mind. In his
misery he gave utterance to a sentence which is in
marked contrast to the sentiments of his comrades.
"Warm thyself," he said, "at the fire of the wise,
but beware of the coals that thou dost not burn
thyself, for their bite is as that of the jackal, their
sting like the scorpion's, their tongues like the
tongues of snakes, and their words are burning
coals." These are the bitter words of a pained
spirit, but they do not deny to his opponents a
measure of justification.</p>

<p>A striking contrast to the stubbornness of
Eliezer, and the no less unbending despotism of
Gamaliel, is offered by Joshua ben Chananya. He
was the yielding, pliable, peaceable element in this
newly constituted Jewish body. He protected the
Law and the people from one-sided and exaggerated
ideas, and became the promoter of the study
of the Law and the benefactor of his people. As
a young Levite of the choir he had seen the glory
of the Temple, and had sung the psalms in its halls.
Together with his teacher he had left Jerusalem,
and after the death of the latter had founded a
school in Bekiin. Here he taught his pupils, and
carried on the humble handicraft of making needles,
by which he maintained his family. Through his
twofold occupation Joshua was brought into communication
both with scholars and the common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
people; and he endeavored to unite the two, and
was the only man who possessed power over the
minds and will of the masses. He was personally
so ugly that an empress's daughter once asked him
how it was so much wisdom was incorporated in
so ugly a form. Whereupon Joshua answered that
wine was not kept in casks of gold.</p>

<p>Besides an acquaintance with tradition, he seems
to have possessed some astronomical knowledge,
which enabled him to calculate the irregular course
of the comets. This knowledge was once of great
use to him when he was on a journey. He had
started on a voyage with Gamaliel, and had
laid in more provisions than were usually necessary
for the journey. The ship took an erratic
course for some time, because its captain, deceived
by the sight of a certain star, had steered in a
wrong direction. Gamaliel's provisions having
been consumed, he was astonished that this was
not the case with his companion, but that, in fact,
he could even spare some for him. Thereupon
Joshua informed him that he had calculated on the
return of a star (a comet), which reappeared
every seventy years, and which would mislead the
ignorant sailor, and that therefore he (Joshua) had
provided himself with extra food for this emergency.
This astronomical knowledge of Joshua
appears the more surprising, as the cycles of the
comets were known not even to the learned of
antiquity. But Joshua was yet more distinguished
for his modesty and gentleness than for knowledge
and wisdom, and these qualities he displayed also
in teaching. He was opposed to all exaggeration
and eccentricity, and gave heed to the circumstances
of daily life when making a legal decision.</p>

<p>Joshua warmly expressed his disapproval of
the numerous measures which the school of
Shammai had introduced before the destruction
of the Temple, under the name of "the eighteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
rules," and which rendered impossible all closer
relations or friendly communications with the
heathens. He said, "On that day, the school of
Shammai went beyond all bounds in their decisions;
they behaved as one who pours water into
a vessel containing oil; the more water one pours
in, the more oil runs off," which meant that, by
introducing a number of superfluous details, the
really important things were lost. Joshua seems
also to have opposed the unmeasured deductions
of the Hillelite school. He said that the regulations
respecting the Sabbath, festive offerings,
and misuse of holy things, have but slight foundation
in Holy Writ, but have many Halachas in their
support.</p>

<p>The balanced and calm character of Joshua rendered
him especially fitted for the part of intermediary
between the Jewish nation and Roman
intolerance. He was the only teacher who sought
and enjoyed the confidence of the Roman rulers;
without betraying his trust to the Romans, he
yet persuaded the opposing forces to be mutually
more yielding. The death of Gamaliel, and the
hostile attitude of the Jews towards the Romans
during the last years of the Emperor Trajan and
the early years of Hadrian's reign, seem to have
torn Joshua away from his petty trade, and to have
put the public leadership into his hands. It is
not improbable that he assumed the patriarchal
position; at least the circumstance that he removed
the ban from Eliezer after the latter's death, an
act which could be performed only by a patriarch,
or one equal in authority, affords some ground for
this supposition. Joshua's activity during the last
years of his life forms an important part of the
history of his times.</p>

<p>Amongst the personages of this period, Akiba
ben Joseph was unquestionably the most talented,
original and influential. His youthful days and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
mental development are shrouded in darkness, as
is often the case with characters who leave their
mark in history; but legends have cast sufficient
light to show the obscurity of his descent. According
to one legend, he was a proselyte, and a descendant
of Sisera, who fell through a woman's deceit.
Another legend represents him as a servant of
Kalba-Sabua, one of the three richest men of
Jerusalem, who, by their provisions, wished to
prevent for many years the famine occasioned by
the siege. The legend adds that the daughter of
one of these wealthy men of Jerusalem, named
Rachel, had bestowed her love on Akiba, on the
condition that he should follow the study of the Law.
In those days this meant to acquire culture, and
thus, in his fortieth year, Akiba entered a school,
in order to take his first lessons to obtain the
knowledge in which he was deficient. During the
period of his studies the daughter of Kalba-Sabua
had remained faithful to him, living in the greatest
poverty, to which her father in his anger had
reduced her by casting her adrift. Of these
stories so much is certain, that Akiba was very
ignorant until he was well advanced in years, that
he and his wife lived under very straitened circumstances,
and he related later on that during the period
of his ignorance, he hated those who were versed
in the Law.</p>

<p>Meanwhile his slumbering mind did not develop
so quickly as the legend relates. One source
declares that he was one of the pupils of Eliezer
during many years, without ever showing himself
worthy of receiving an instructive reply from
him. His teacher appears to have regarded him with
a certain amount of contempt. Perhaps the peculiar
system, pursued by Rabbi Akiba with regard to the
newer Halachas, also excited Eliezer's disapproval.
Akiba had learned this new system under Nachum
of Gimso (or Emmaus), under whom he studied, not,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
indeed, for two-and-twenty years, as the legend
relates. Akiba raised what was incomplete and
fragmentary in this school to a complete system,
and thus he stands at a turning-point in Jewish
history.</p>

<p>The peculiar system of Akiba was built on certain
principles, and in fact he may be considered as the
only systematic Tanai. In this system the law was
not considered as a dead treasure incapable of
growth or development, or, as it was in the eyes
of Eliezer, a wealth of mere memories, but it formed
an everlasting quarry in which, with proper means,
new treasures might always be found. New laws
were also no longer to be formulated by the voice
of a majority, but were to be justified by and founded
on the written documents of the Holy Word. As
the fundamental doctrine of his system, Akiba
maintained that the style of the Torah, especially
in parts relating to the laws (Halachas), was quite
different from that of other writings. Human language,
besides the indispensable words employed,
requires certain expressions, figures of speech,
repetitions, and enlargements&mdash;in fact it takes a
certain form which is almost unnecessary for conveying
the writer's meaning, but which is used as a
matter of taste, in order to round off the sentences
and to make them more finished and artistic. In
the language of the Torah, on the other hand, no
weight is put on the form; nothing is superfluous,
no word, no syllable, not even a letter; every peculiarity
of expression, every additional word, every
sign is to be regarded as of great importance, as a
hint of a deeper meaning that lies buried within.
Akiba added a number of explanatory and deductive
rules to those of Hillel and Nachum, and his
additions afforded fresh means of development for
the traditional law. When a deduction had been
obtained by the correct use of the rules, such conclusion
might again be employed as the foundation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
for fresh deductions, and so on, in a continuous
chain.</p>

<p>Akiba was not to be restrained in this course by
any consequences whatsoever. He had opened up
a new path with his system, and a new point of
view. The Oral Law, of which it had been said that
it hung on a hair and had no firm ground in Holy
Writ, was thus placed on a firmer basis, and the
dissensions concerning the Halachas were to a considerable
degree diminished. Akiba's contemporaries
were surprised, dazzled, and inspired by his
theories, which were new and yet old. Tarphon,
who had at one time been the superior of Akiba,
said to him, "He who departs from thee departs
from life eternal; for what has been forgotten in
the handing down, that dost thou give afresh in thy
explanations." It was acknowledged that the Law
would have been forgotten or neglected, had not
Akiba given it his support. With exaggerated
enthusiasm, it was said that many enactments of
law, which were unknown to Moses, were revealed
to Akiba.</p>

<p>Just as Akiba had recognized and confirmed the
worth of the traditional law, he also assisted in
reducing it to a methodical system and order. He
laid the foundation for the possible collection of the
rich material at hand. It has already been stated
that the Halachas were strung together without
connection or systematic grouping; it was therefore
necessary, in order to retain the entire mass,
to maintain years of intimacy with those who were
acquainted with the Halachas, to be untiringly
industrious, and to have a faithful memory. Akiba,
however, facilitated the study of the Halachas by
arranging them in groups, and thus assisted the
memory. The arranging of the Halachas he carried
out in two ways. He put them together according
to their context, so that all Halachas concerning
the Sabbath, marriage laws, divorces, and property<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
should form independent wholes. Thus the entire
matter was divided into six similar parts, each part
bearing the name Masechta (Textus&mdash;Division).
These divisions he arranged according to numbers,
so as to give a useful aid to the memory; thus,
from four causes injuries to property might occur;
five classes of men could be excluded from the
tithes of the priests; fifteen classes of women were
prevented by consanguinity from intermarrying with
their brothers-in-law; thirty-six kinds of sins are
recorded in the Holy Writings as being punished
by extermination. The collection of the Halachas,
instituted by Akiba, was called the Mishna, or more
fully Mishna of Rabbi Akiba, to distinguish it from
the later collection; in Christian circles it was known
under the name of Akiba's Deuterosis. It was also
called Midoth (Measures), probably on account of
the numbers which form the basis of arrangement.
This Mishna or Midoth, though arranged, was not
written down; the contents remained as before
traditional, but an easier method was employed in
classifying them. It is hardly probable that Akiba
alone completed and arranged all this material.
His pupils no doubt assisted in this collection which,
later on, formed the foundation of the code that
terminated the whole traditional system.</p>

<p>The older Mishnas (Mishna Rishona) were often
separated from the later (Mishna Acharona, or
Mishna of Rabbi Akiba), and the latter were taken
as the norm. The name of the new founder of
the Oral Law became, through his peculiar mode
of teaching, one of the most celebrated in the
Jewish communities far and wide. His mysterious
descent and his lowly origin only heightened the
interest felt in him. The number of his hearers
is exaggerated by tradition, which fixes it at twelve
thousand, and even double that number, but a more
modest record represents them as amounting to
three hundred. Accompanied by this numerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
band of disciples, Akiba again visited his wife
Rachel, who for some years had lived apart from
him in the greatest poverty. The scene of their
meeting is touchingly described, and her hard-hearted
father, Kalba-Sabua, proud of such a son-in-law,
is said to have bequeathed to him his whole
property. From this time Akiba lived in great
riches with his wife, who had previously been so
poor that she slept on a bed of straw. His gratitude
to his sorely tried wife was in proportion to
the sacrifices which she had made for him.</p>

<p>Akiba had his fixed domicile in Bene-Berak,
where his school was situated. The position of
this spot, which, through him, became so celebrated,
is supposed to be southeast of Joppa. Others
place it yet more to the south, near Ashdod; but
Akiba was a member of the Synhedrion in Jabne,
and it was but seldom that any measure was determined
without him.</p>

<p>In the development of Jewish law, in which Akiba
had wrought such changes, Ishmael ben Elisha took
an important part. He demanded the explanation
of the written law from the common-sense view,
and was thus one of the chief opponents of Akiba's
system. According to Ishmael, the divine precepts
of the Torah are expressed in human language, in
which various figures of speech, linguistic repetitions
and oratorical modes of expression occur, on which,
however, no weight should be laid, as they are a
mere matter of form. He thus put aside the various
deductions of Akiba, which were based on an apparently
superfluous (pleonastic) word, or even letter
of the alphabet. Akiba deduced, for example, the
punishment of death by fire against the adulterous
married daughter of a priest from one letter of the
alphabet, on which Ishmael remarked&mdash;"On account
of one letter of the alphabet thou wouldst inflict
death by burning!" Ishmael had his own school,
which was known under the name of Be-Rabbi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
Ishmael. He there developed the rules which were
to be employed in explaining and applying the
Written Law. He amplified Hillel's seven rules
of interpretation into thirteen, by subdividing one
into several, while he rejected another, and on his
own authority added one which was quite new.</p>

<p>The thirteen deductive rules of Ishmael are recognized
as the complete form, but the system of
Akiba, although partly opposed to it, was not thereby
excluded from use, for both were equally employed
by succeeding teachers. There is but little else
known of Ishmael. He belongs to a circle which,
doubtless for political reasons, was relegated by the
Synhedrion from Jabne to Usha. He subsequently
paid for his love for his nation and the Law with
his life. Akiba, though an opponent of the theories
held by him, gave a funeral address in praise of
him, and was impressed with the idea that a similar
fate would soon befall himself.</p>

<p>These five men&mdash;Gamaliel, the arranger; Eliezer,
the strict upholder of tradition; Joshua, the conciliator;
Akiba, the systematizer; and Ishmael, the
clear thinker, were the center-point of that period;
they formed the rays which, starting from one point,
diverge in order to be finally reunited in another.</p>

<p>The maintaining and cultivation of the inherited
Law was a point of union for all men of activity and
intelligence, and to it they turned all their energy,
mind and power. The numerous teachers of this
second generation of Tanaites were called the
Armed (Baâle Trêssin), because the Synhedrion
and schools constituted a battle-field on which the
combatants contested for the Law (machai nomikai).
The group was composed partly of members of the
Synhedrion who had a voice in every decision; partly
of ordained members who, through the ceremony
of "laying on of hands," were elevated to the rank
of "wise men," from whose midst the college was
wont to fill up vacancies; and, lastly, there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
disciples who sat on the ground as listeners at "the
feet of the masters."</p>

<p>Amongst the most important members was Tarphon
of Lydda; he was rich and generous, passionate
and hasty&mdash;a zealous enemy of the Jewish
Christians. Further, there were Eliezer of Modin,
an authority on Agadic explanations; and José, the
Galilæan, whose heart was soft and full of love for
humanity. There was also Isebab, the clerk of the
Synhedrion; Chuzpit, the public orator or interpreter;
Judah ben Baba, the Chassidæan (he probably
belonged to the order of the Essenes); Chananya
ben Teradion, who, together with those just
named, suffered the death of a martyr. Besides these
were Eleazar Chasma and Jochanan ben Gudgada,
both of whom were celebrated on account of their
deep mathematical knowledge and their poverty,
but they were put in possession of lucrative posts by
the patriarch at the express intervention of Joshua;
Jochanan ben Nuri, a zealous disciple of Gamaliel;
Joseph ben Kisma, an admirer of the Romans; and,
lastly, Ilai and Chalafta, both of whom became better
known through their sons. From the class of disciples
only four distinguished themselves in history,
Samuel, the younger, and three others&mdash;all of whom
were named Simon. The disciples consisted of those
who, for some reason, had not been amongst the
ordained, and who were thus excluded from certain
functions, such as membership of the Synhedrion and
the holding of certain judicial offices. To these was
denied the title of Rabbi&mdash;equivalent to the title of
doctor in our times, but not corresponding to the
title of Reverend. The title of Rabbi was, in fact,
first used from the time of the destruction of the
Temple, and was probably introduced by the disciples
of Jochanan ben Zakkai, who were called master
by their adherents.</p>

<p>Samuel the Younger (Hakaton) was a man of
rare modesty and abnegation, a "true disciple of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
Hillel"; he was chiefly known for his condemnation
of the Jewish Christians, and for the prophetic
glance, which, when on his death-bed, he cast into the
gloomy future. He uttered the prophetic words:
"Simon and Ishmael are doomed to destruction;
the nation is threatened with anarchy, and heavy
persecutions will follow." Those around knew not
what to make of his utterances, but he foresaw the
coming troubles under Hadrian. Samuel died childless,
and the Patriarch himself delivered an address
in his memory.</p>

<p>Simon ben Nanos was renowned on account of his
intimate acquaintance with the law of the individual,
and Ishmael recommended all those who were learned
in the Law to cultivate an acquaintance with ben-Nanos.
Simon ben Asai was an enemy to marriage,
and, together with Simon ben Zoma, he became
absorbed in the theosophic speculations of the
times. Amongst the great number of teachers of
the Law, of whom many lost their lives, only one is
named as having deserted his people, and thus
having attained to undesirable notoriety. This was
Elisha ben Abuya, better known by his apostate
name Acher, who became a persecutor of the Law
and of those who adhered to it. Outside of Judæa,
and particularly in Babylon, there existed centers
for the growth of spiritual activity. Judah ben
Bathyra, who taught in Nisibis, a town in Babylon,
was probably a descendant of the family Bene
Bathyra, which, in the time of King Herod, had
been at the head of the Synhedrion. In Nahardea,
Nehemia is named as the teacher of the traditional
Law in Beth-Deli. From this center there seems to
have originated, as will be shown later on, the chief
opposition to Trajan's plans for conquest in the district
of the Euphrates. In Asia Minor, likewise, the
study of the Halachas was pursued, though the names
of its teachers have not been preserved. Cæsarea,
the capital of Cappadocia (also called Mazaca), appears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
to have been the chief seat of this branch of
study. Rabbi Akiba, during his journey in Asia Minor,
found in the latter place a man learned in traditions,
who held a discussion with him concerning the Halachas.
The Jews of Egypt, who had closed the temple
of Onias at the command of Vespasian, and had thus
lost their seat of learning, appear to have pursued
their studies of the Halachas in Alexandria. They
continued to occupy themselves with the translation
of such writings as resembled the Holy Writ or the
Apocryphal Literature. Sirach translated the sayings
of his grandfather into Greek, and others
translated the book of Susannah and the Letter of
Baruch. Additions were also made to the Books
of Esther and Daniel. These later additions to
Hebrew poetry were considered by Christians as
part of the Bible. In Judæa, however, no attention
was paid to these foreign schools, but the
Synhedrion of Jabne was regarded as the supreme
authority.</p>

<p>The Synhedrion of Jamnia had become the heart of
the Jewish nation, whence life and activity streamed
forth to the most distant communities. Thence
proceeded all arrangements and decisions relating
to religious matters, which were to become popular,
and the observance of which was to be ensured.
The nation regarded the Synhedrion as a remnant
of the State, and paid to the Nasi (the President), a
member of the house of Hillel and a descendant of
David, an amount of reverence such as might be
shown to royalty. The Greek title Ethnarch, which
means Ruler of the People, and which approaches
nearest to the description of a king, seems to
show that with the Patriarchate was associated the
princely dignity. Therefore the people were proud
of the house of Hillel, because through its members
the ruling power remained in the house of
David, and thus the prediction of the patriarch
Jacob was verified, "that the scepter should not depart
from the tribe of Judah." After the Patriarch
came his representative Ab-beth-din, and the
Chacham (the Wise), whose special office is not
known. The Patriarch had the right of appointing
judges and the officers of the congregation, and
probably supervised their actions. The Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
government had not yet interfered with the communal
arrangements of the Jews so far as to cause
the judicial offices to be performed by Romans.
The authority of the Patriarch left the power of the
teacher, however, undiminished in certain of the
schools; they could confer on their disciples the
dignities of judge or teacher of the people, and the
assent of the Patriarch was not required. The
master laid his hand on the head of the pupil, and
this ordination was called <i xml:lang="he" lang="he">Semicha</i>, or <i xml:lang="he" lang="he">Minui</i>, and
meant Nomination, Ordination, or Promotion. The
ordained bore the title <i xml:lang="he" lang="he">Zaken</i> (Elder), which was
almost equivalent to that of Senator, for through
this ordination they obtained the right of membership
of the Council when the choice should fall on
them.</p>

<p>The chief activity of the Patriarch was felt at the
public meetings of the Synhedrion. He occupied
the highest place, supported by the chief members
who were seated around in a half-circle.
Behind these members, whose number at this time
was probably seventy, there were several rows of
the ordained, behind whom stood the pupils, and
at the back the people seated on the ground witnessed
the proceedings.</p>

<p>The Patriarch opened the meeting either by introducing
some subject of discussion from the Laws,
or by inviting the members to speak by the formula
"Ask." If he himself spoke first, he uttered
some sentences softly to the Meturgeman, who
then developed and explained them in an oratorical
manner. Any person had the right to put
questions: while the discussion was being held the
assembly would divide into groups and debate on
the matter. The president had the right to close
the discussion, and to bring about its conclusion
by saying, "The subject has been sufficiently discussed."
After the conclusion no one was permitted
to return to theoretical discussions. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
appears that the ordained members also had the
right of voting. In voting on criminal cases all
votes were taken, the youngest members beginning,
so that they, by coming first, might not be
guided by the most influential men; in other matters
this method was reversed. Such was the
procedure at meetings of the Synhedrion when
questions were to be answered, disputed laws to
be settled, new arrangements introduced, or old ones
to be set aside.</p>

<p>The Patriarch also exercised an important function
in fixing the dates of the festivals. The
Jewish Calendar was not permanently fixed, but had
to be regulated from time to time. The year was
in fact partly solar, partly lunar, the festivals being
dependent on the course of the moon, and on the
influence of the sun on the harvests, and the varying
course of the solar and lunar years had to be
equalized. Thus, when the solar year exceeded the
lunar by a month, which occurred every two or
three years, a month was inserted, and this leap-year
contained thirteen lunar months. The length
of the months was also uncertain; a month, according
to tradition, was to commence when the
new moon became visible, and this period was
decided partly by astronomical calculations and
partly by the evidence of actual witnesses. As
soon as the witnesses reported to the Synhedrion
that the first streak of the young moon
was visible, that day was fixed as the first day
of the month, provided it concurred with calculations
made. If no witnesses presented themselves,
the doubtful day was counted in the current
month. The month thus contained twenty-nine or
thirty days. The new moon was celebrated in a
solemn manner, and was announced in earlier times
by means of bonfires, which could easily be used
in a mountainous country throughout the land.
Burning torches were seen on the Mount of Olives,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
as also on Mount Sartaba (Alexandrion), and on
Mount Tabor, and so on, as far as Beth-Beltis, on the
Babylonian frontier. On the doubtful day between
the two months the Babylonian community looked
out for the signal, and repeated it for the benefit of
those who lived afar. The congregations in Egypt,
in Asia Minor and in Greece, however, could not
use bonfires, they were uncertain as to the day on
which the new moon fell, and, therefore, they kept
two days instead of one. The intercalary month
was announced by the Patriarch in a circular letter
to the community.</p>

<p>The Patriarch Gamaliel introduced the use of
set prayers. Although some of the prayers were
very ancient, and were used in the Temple at the
time of the burnt-offerings, yet the chief prayers of
those days were not formulated, but each man
was left to pray in whatever words his feelings
dictated to him. Gamaliel introduced the daily
prayers, the eighteen <i xml:lang="he" lang="he">Berachoth</i> (blessings), which
are used in the synagogues at the present day. It
is not known by whom the prayers were introduced
for the Sabbath and the Festivals. Prayers were
universally considered as a substitute for offerings,
and were called "the offerings of the heart." The
public service was very simple; there were no official
readers, any one who had attained a certain
age and was of good repute could pray; the congregation
called on him to do so, and he was named
"the delegate of the community." He stood before
the ark in which lay the scrolls of the Law, and,
therefore, to pray was called "to go before the ark."</p>

<p>The Law, with the exception of the sacrificial system,
was strictly enforced. The tithes were paid to
the descendants of Aaron, the corners of the fields
were left standing for the poor, and every three years
the poor-tithes were paid. In remembrance of the
Temple, for whose restoration the most earnest
hopes were awakened, many observances were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
retained, which could only be of meaning there.
All those who fulfilled strictly the requirements
of the Law, giving up the tenth part of all the
fruits which they possessed, formed a sort of order
(<i xml:lang="he" lang="he">Chaburah</i>), the members of which were called
fellows (<i xml:lang="he" lang="he">Chaberim</i>).</p>

<p>In contradistinction to this order were the peasants&mdash;the
slaves of the soil. A striking picture is
given of the neglected mental and moral state of
these peasants, to which the frequent rebellions
during the last years of the Jewish state no doubt
contributed. They only observed such laws as
appealed to their rude senses, and knew nothing of
a higher life. The members of the order would not
eat or live with them, and even kept aloof from
them, that their clothes might not be made unclean
by contact. It was said by contemporaries that the
hatred between the two classes was stronger than
that felt between Jews and heathens.</p>

<p>Thus left to themselves and cut off from the
higher classes and from all share in communal
life, without a leader or adviser, the peasants
easily fell under the influence of young Christianity.
Jesus and his disciples had especially
turned towards the unprotected class, and had there
found the greater number of their followers. How
flattering it must have been to these neglected
beings to hear that on their account the Messiah
had come, that he had been executed so that they
might have a share in the good things of which
they had been deprived, more especially of happiness
in a better world. The Law deprived them of
their rights, while Christianity opened the kingdom
of heaven to them!</p>

<p>The teachers of the Law, absorbed in the task of
upholding the Law and Jewish life, overlooked the
element from which a mighty foe to the Law
would arise. Before they realized it they found an
enemy on their own ground, who was desirous of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
obtaining the treasure which they had watched with
such devotion. The development of Christianity as
a branch of Judaism, drawing sustenance from its
roots, constitutes, so long as its followers belonged
to the Jewish people, a part of Jewish history.</p>

<p>Of the small group of a hundred and twenty
persons, who, after the death of Jesus, had formed
his sole followers, a Christian community had been
formed, especially through the energy of Paul. He
endeavored to win over the heathens by the belief
in the resurrection of Christ, and the Jews by the
belief that the actual appearance of the Messiah
had proved the inefficacy of the Jewish Law.
Christianity could no longer be contemptuously
overlooked, but began to be a new element in
history. But the doctrine of Paul that the Jewish
Law was unnecessary, had sown the seed of dissension
in primitive Christianity, and the followers of
Jesus were divided into two great parties, which
were again divided into smaller sects, with special
views and modes of life. Sectarianism did not show
itself for the first time in Christianity, as is supposed,
in the second century, but was present at its very
commencement, and was a necessary result of
fundamental differences. The two great parties,
which were arrayed in sharp opposition, were, on
the one hand, the <i>Jewish</i> Christians, and, on the
other, the <i>Pagan</i> Christians. The Jewish Christians,
belonging to the original community, which was
composed of Jews, were closely connected with
Judaism. They observed the Jewish laws in all
their details, and pointed to the example of Jesus,
who himself had lived according to Jewish laws.
They put these words into the mouth of the founder
of the religion, "Sooner shall heaven and earth
disappear, than that an iota or a grain of the
Law shall not be fulfilled"; further, "I have not
come to destroy the Law of Moses, but to fulfil it."
They entertained a hostile spirit towards the Pagan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
Christians, and applied to them one of the sayings
of Jesus, "He who alters any, even the most trivial
of the laws, and teaches mankind accordingly, shall
be the last in the kingdom of heaven; but he who
obeys them, and teaches them, shall be considered
great in the kingdom of heaven." Even the devotion
of Jewish Christians to Jesus was not of a
nature to separate them from Judaism. They considered
him as a holy and morally great man, who
was descended in the natural way from the race of
David. This son of David had advanced the
kingdom of heaven because he taught men to live
modestly and in poverty, like the Essenes, from
whose midst, in fact, Christianity had sprung. From
their contempt of riches and preference for poverty
they bore the name of Ebionites or Ebionim (poor),
which was travestied by their Christian opponents
into a nickname meaning "poor in spirit." Fearing
to be eclipsed by the other party, the primitive
Jewish Christian community sent out messengers to
the foreign communities, in order to impress on
them not only the Messianic character of Jesus, but
also the duty which they owed to the Law. Thus
they founded Judæo-Christian colonies, of which
that at Rome in time became the chief.</p>

<p>In opposition to these were the heathen Christians.
As the term "Son of God," as used in the language
of the prophets, contained an idea entirely incomprehensible
to them, they interpreted it according
to their own mode of thought, as meaning God's
actual Son, a conception which was as clear and
acceptable to the heathen as it was strange and
repulsive to the Jews. When once the idea of a
Son of God was accepted, it became necessary to
eliminate from the life of Jesus all those traits
which appertained to him as a human being, such as
his natural birth from parents, and thus the statement
developed that this Son of God was born of
a virgin through the Holy Ghost. The first great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
difference between the Ebionites and the heathen
Christians lay in their views concerning the person
of Jesus; the one honoring him as the son of
David, the other worshiping him as the Son of God.
The second point turned on the stress to be laid
on the laws of Judaism. The heathen party paid
but little attention to the laws relating to the
community of property and contempt for riches,
which were the chief ends of Ebionite Christianity.
The heathen or Hellenic Christians had their chief
seat in Asia Minor, namely, in seven cities, which,
in the symbolical language of that time, were called
the seven stars and the seven golden lamps.
Ephesus was the chief of these heathen Christian
congregations. Between the Ebionite and Hellenic
congregations, which possessed in common only the
name of the founder, there arose strained relations
and a mutual dislike, which became more bitter with
time. Paul and his disciples were fiercely hated by
the Jewish Christians. They did not cease, even
after his death, to use expressions of contempt
against the circumcised apostle who only spread
error. Admiring the unity and solidarity which
prevailed in the Jamnian Synhedrion, in contrast
to the dissensions which reigned in the Christian
community, a Jewish Christian wrote: "Our fellow-tribesmen
follow to the present day the
same law concerning the unity of God and the
proper mode of life, and cannot form a different
opinion of the meaning of the Scriptures. It
is only according to prescribed rules that they
endeavor to bring into agreement the sayings of
Scripture, but they do not permit a man to teach
unless he has learnt beforehand how to explain the
Holy Scriptures. They have but one God, one
Law, one hope. If we do not follow the same
course, our word of truth will, through the variety
of opinion, be shattered. This I know, not as a
prophet, but because I see the root of the evil;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
for some of the heathens have put aside with the
Law the prophecies in agreement with it, and have
adopted the unlawful and absurd teachings of an
enemy (Paul)." These words are placed in the
mouth of Peter, the second of the apostles. But
the Ebionites not only called Paul's predictions and
instructions, of which he thought so much, unlawful
and absurd, but gave him a nickname, which was
meant to brand him and his followers. They called
him Simon Magus, a half-Jewish (Samaritan) wizard,
who is said to have bewitched all the world with his
words. He was said also to have been baptized,
but it was asserted that he had not received his
position as apostle through the Holy Ghost from
Jesus' disciples, but had sought it through bribes to
the Ebionite community. The honor was not only
absolutely refused to him, but Simon Peter had
threatened him with damnation, for his heart was
full of deceit, bitterness, and injustice. The freedom
from the Jewish Law inaugurated by Paul was
characterized as unbridled license, as the teaching of
Balaam, which brought in its train the worship of idols
and the pursuit of vice. The leaders of the heathens
did not hesitate to reply in a similar strain, and
perhaps repaid their opponents with even greater
hatred when, to religious opposition, there was
added the dislike of the Romans and Greeks to the
Jews, even after they had become followers of
Jesus. In the larger Christian congregations the
two sects often fell into distinct groups and became
isolated from each other. In the circular letters,
which the chiefs of the various Christian parties
were accustomed to send to the communities, they
made use of sharp or condemnatory observations
against the opponents of the opinions which they
held to be the only true ones. Even the stories of
the birth of Jesus, his works, sufferings, death and
resurrection, which were written down, under the
title of the Evangels, only in the first quarter of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
second century, were colored by the views of the
two parties, who put teachings and sayings into the
mouth of the Founder of Christianity, not as he had
uttered them, but according to their own views.
These narratives were favorable to the Law of the
Jews and to the Jews themselves, when they emanated
from the Ebionites, and inimical towards both in the
accounts written by the followers of Paul, the heathen
Christians. The evangelists were thus polemical
writers.</p>

<p>The division between the Ebionites and the
heathen Christians was by no means confined to
religious belief, but had a political background.
The Jewish Christians hated Rome, the Romans,
the Emperor, and their officials as much as the
Jews did. One of their prophets (said to be John,
an imitator of the visions of Daniel), who had composed
the first Christian Revelation or Apocalypse,
was inspired with the deepest hatred towards the
town of seven hills, the great Babylon. All the evil
in the world, all the depredations and plagues, all
the contempt and humiliation were announced and
invoked in this first Christian Revelation against
sinful Rome. They did not imagine that she would,
at a future time, become the capital of Christianity.
On the other hand, the followers of Paul not only
recommended subjection to the Roman Empire, but
even declared it to have been appointed by God.
The Christian party, without any regard for those
Jews who were imbued with a love of liberty, continually
recommended that taxes and tithes should
be handed to the Romans. This submission to the
existing power, this coqueting with sinful Rome,
which the Jewish Christians thought doomed to
destruction, was another source of disunion amongst
various sects of Christians.</p>

<p>Between the Jews and the Jewish Christians there
existed at first tolerable relations. The former
called the latter Sectaries (Minim, Minæans). Even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
the Tanaite and Ebionite teachers mixed freely with
each other. The strict Rabbi Eliezer, who refused to
the heathens their share and part in life everlasting,
had had an interview with the Jewish Christian,
Jacob of Kephar-Samia, and quietly listened to his
version, as he had received it from Jesus. Once,
Bendama, a nephew of Ishmael, having been bitten
by a snake, determined to let himself be cured by
means of an exorcism uttered by Jacob. The transition
from Judaism to Christianity was not a striking
one. It is probable that various members of Jewish
families belonged to the Jewish-Christian belief
without giving rise to dissensions or disturbing the
domestic peace. It is related of Hanania, the
nephew of Joshua, that he had joined the Christian
congregation at Capernaum; but that his uncle,
who disapproved, removed him from Christian
influences, and sent him to Babylon.</p>

<p>But the Jewish Christians, also, did not remain
content with the simple idea of Jesus as the Messiah.
They gradually and unconsciously, like the
heathen Christians, adorned him with God-like attributes,
and endowed him with miraculous powers.
The more the Jewish-Christian conception idealized
Jesus, the more it became separated from Judaism,
with which it still thought itself at one. There
arose mixed sects from among the Ebionites and
Hellenites, and one could perceive a gradual descent
from the law-abiding Ebionites to the law-despising
Antitaktes. The Nazarenes came next to the
Ebionites. They also acknowledged the power of
the Jewish law in its entirety; but they explained
the birth of Jesus in a supernatural manner&mdash;from
the Virgin and the Holy Ghost&mdash;and ascribed to
him God-like attributes. Other Jewish Christians
went further than the Nazarenes, and gave up
the Law, either in part or altogether. After such
proceedings, a total breach between Jews and
Jewish Christians was inevitable. At length a time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
arrived when the latter themselves felt that they no
longer belonged to the Jewish community, and
therefore they entirely withdrew from it. The letter
of separation which the Jewish community sent to
the parent body is yet in existence. It calls on the
Jewish followers of Jesus to separate wholly from
their fellow-countrymen. In the Agadic method of
that period, the Epistle to the Hebrews sets forth
that the crucified Messiah is at the same time the
expiatory sacrifice and the atoning priest. It proves
from the Law that those sacrifices whose blood was
sprinkled in the Holy of Holies, were considered
the holiest, and the bodies were burnt outside
the Temple. "Therefore"&mdash;thus continues the
Jewish-Christian monitor&mdash;"Jesus, also, that he
might sanctify the people through his own blood,
suffered without the gate (of Jerusalem). Let us,
therefore, go forth unto him without the camp (the
Jewish community), bearing his reproach, for we
have not here an abiding city (Jerusalem as the
symbol of the Jewish religion), but we seek after the
city which is to come." When once a decided step
had been taken to divide the Nazarenes and the
cognate sects from the Jewish community, a deadly
hate arose against the Jews and Judaism. Like the
heathen Christians, the Nazarenes reviled the Jews
and their ways. As the written Law was holy to
them also, they directed their shafts against the
study of Halachas amongst the Tanaites, who in
those days were the very life of Judaism. In Jewish-Christian,
as in Jewish circles, men were accustomed
to view all events from the point of view of Holy
Writ, and to draw counsel from the explanations
and references in the prophecies. The Nazarenes,
therefore, applied to the Tanaites, whom they called
Deuterotes, and more especially to the schools of
Hillel and Shammai, a threatening verse of Isaiah
(viii. 14): "It shall be a stone of stumbling and the
downfall of both the houses of Israel." "By the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
two houses the prophet meant the two scholastic
sects of Shammai and Hillel, from whose midst
the Scribes and Pharisees had arisen, and whose
successors were Akiba, Jochanan, the son of Zakkai,
then Eliezer and Delphon (Tarphon), and then again
Joseph the Galilean and Joshua. These are the two
houses which do not recognize the Savior; and
this shall, therefore, bring them to downfall and
destruction." Yet another verse from the same
prophet, which runs, "They mock the people through
the word" (Is. xxix. 21), the Nazarenes applied to
the teachers of the Mishna, "who contemn the
nation through their bad traditions." They place
taunts in the mouth of Jesus against the teachers
of the Law, which might, perhaps, apply to one or
another of them, but which as applied to the whole
body were a calumnious libel. They make him say,
"On the seat of Moses (the Synhedrion) sit the
Scribes and Pharisees; all that they say you must
follow and do; but their works ye shall not do,
for they speak and do not act in accordance....
All their works they do so that people may notice
them. They use wide phylacteries and fringes on
their garments. They love to have the chief place
at meals and in the synagogues, to be greeted by
other men in the public places, and to be called
Rabbi, Rabbi.... Woe to you, ye hypocritical
Scribes and Pharisees, who devour the substance
of the widow under the pretense that ye pray long;
therefore shall ye receive punishment; ... woe
to you, that ye tithe the herbs of the ground&mdash;both
dill and cummin, and that ye leave undone the
weightier matters of the Law, judgment, mercy and
faith. The one must be done, but the other should
not be omitted. You blind souls who strain at gnats
and swallow camels, ... who cleanse the outside
of the cups and platters and leave them within full
to the brim with extortion and corruption."</p>

<p>Thus the leaders of the Jewish Christians were
opposed to the Judaism of the Torah, and thus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
without actually desiring it, they played into the
hands of the Hellenes. The teaching of Paul thus
gained more and more ground, and came at last to
be considered as true Christianity, as the catholic,
the universal religion. It was, therefore, natural
that the various sects of Ebionites and Nazarenes
should gradually disappear amongst the ever-increasing
numbers of the heathen Christians, and
that they should become few in numbers and miserable
in condition&mdash;an object of contempt both to
Jews and Christians. A peculiar phenomenon was
offered in this contest of opinions, that the further
the Jewish Christians departed from the Law, the
nearer did the Hellenes approach to it. In the
various epistles and letters which the Christian
teachers sent to the congregations, or to their
various representatives, they could not sufficiently
denounce those who sought to make way for the
Law and the Jewish teachings.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Christianity developed a number of
sects with most curious titles, and of the most eccentric
tendency. Half a century after the destruction
of the Temple, the two forms of religion in the Old
World (Judaism and Paganism) underwent a transformation
and partial union. Judaism being without
a state or point of centralization, endeavored to
consolidate itself, whilst the Pagan world, in the full
flush of its power, became disintegrated, and a disturbance
was caused in men's minds which led to
the most extraordinary results.</p>

<p>To the two elements borrowed from Judaism and
Christianity there were added others from the Judæan-Alexandrian
system of Philo, from Grecian
philosophy, and, in fact, from all corners of the earth,
whose source can hardly be determined. It was a
confusion of the most opposite modes of thought
and teachings, Jewish and heathen, old and new,
true and false, the lofty and the low, all in close
juxtaposition and fusion. It seemed as though on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
the advent of Christianity into the world, all the
most decided teachings of ancient times had bestowed
a part of their contents on it, in order to
obtain thereby importance and duration. The old
question&mdash;whence did evil arise in this world&mdash;and
how its existence could be reconciled with the
idea of a good and just providence, occupied in the
liveliest manner all minds which had been made
acquainted with Jewish dogmas by means of the
Christian apostles. It was only through a new conception
of God that it seemed possible to solve this
question, and this new belief was pieced together
from the most varied religious systems. The higher
knowledge of God, His relation to the world and
to religious and moral life, was called Gnosis;
those who thought that they possessed it called
themselves Gnostics, and understood thereby highly
gifted beings, who had penetrated the secrets of
creation.</p>

<p>The Gnostics, or more correctly, the Theosophists,
who hovered between Judaism, Christianity and
Paganism, and who borrowed their views and forms
of thought from these three circles, were drawn also
from the adherents of these three religions. So
powerful must have been the charm of the Gnostic
teaching, that the authorities of the Synagogue and
the Church enacted numberless rules and ordinances
against it, and were yet powerless to prevent Gnostic
teachings and formulæ from gaining ground
amongst the Jews and the Christians. Gnosticism
spread throughout Judæa, Egypt, Syria, Asia Minor,
and flourished especially in Rome&mdash;the capital of
the world&mdash;where all religious views and creeds
found followers. The language of the Gnostics was
of a mystic-allegorical character, often borrowed
from Jewish and Christian confessions of creed, but
treated in an entirely different manner. Some of
the Gnostic sects exemplified the peculiarities of the
tendency of those times. One sect called themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>
Cainites, for no other reason than that its
disciples, in defiance of the Biblical narrative, regarded
the fratricide Cain as superior to Abel. The
Cainites also honored the depraved Sodomites,
Esau, in spite of his savagery, and the ambitious
Korah. The Ophites and Naasites were filled with
similar love of opposition to the Biblical accounts,
but they assigned to it a better motive than that of
the Cainites. They took their name from the Greek
word Ophis and the Hebrew Nahash (Naas) serpent,
and honored this animal very highly, because in the
Bible the serpent is considered as the origin of evil,
and, according to the ideas of those times, was looked
upon as the symbol of evil, and as the form taken
by Satan. The Ophites gave thanks to the serpent,
by whose means the first human pair were led into
disobedience against God, and thus to the recognition
of good and evil and of consciousness in
general.</p>

<p>Varied and contradictory as were the tendencies
of the Gnostic sects, they yet had doctrines in common.
The fundamental Gnostic doctrines concerned
the actual knowledge of God, which its founders
developed in opposition to the idea of God formulated
by Judaism. The Gnostics pictured to themselves
the Divine Being as divided into two principles
of a God and a Creator, the one subordinate
to the other. God they called Silence or Rest,
and depicted him as enthroned in the empyrean
heights, without relation to the world. His fundamental
attributes were grace, love, mercy. From him
proceeded emanations which revealed a portion of
his essence; these emanations were called æons
(worlds). Beneath this highest of all beings they
set the Creator of the world (Demiurge), whom they
also called Ruler. To him they assigned the work
of creation; he directed the world, he had delivered
the people of Israel, and given them the Law. As
to the highest God appertain love and mercy, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>
harmonize with freedom, so to the fundamental
character of the world's creator appertain justice
and severity, which he causes to be felt through laws
and obligations. According to the usual practice of
the age, the Gnostics found a passage of Scripture
to illustrate these relations between the God of
justice and the God of grace. Isaiah vii. 6 reads:
"We will go up to Judah, and instal another king,
the son of the good God (Tab-El)." They depict
the Creator as forming the world out of primeval
matter by means of wisdom (Achamot). "Wisdom,"
as it is expressed in their allegorical language, "became
allied with primeval matter which existed from
eternity, and a variety of forms were brought forth;
but wisdom became thereby bedimmed and darkened."
According to this exposition, the Gnostics
assumed that there were three original Beings&mdash;the
highest God, the Creator, and Primeval Matter,
and from these they developed the various conditions
and stages in the spiritual and actual world.
All that is good and noble is accounted an emanation
from God; justice and law come from the
Creator; but what is imperfect, bad, or crippled in
this world is the result of the primeval matter.</p>

<p>In correspondence with this Gnostic division of the
three powers of the world, there are also amongst
mankind three classes or castes, which are in the
service of these three principles. There are spiritual
men (Pneumatics); they are as a rule and law to
themselves, and do not need guidance or guardianship;
to this class belong the prophets, and the
possessors of the true Gnosis. There are, secondly,
material men (Psychics), who are in the service of
the lawgiving Demiurge; they stand under the
yoke of the Law, by means of which they keep
themselves aloof from what is worldly, without,
however, rising to the height of spiritual men.
Lastly, there are earthly men (Choics), who, like the
lower animals, are bound in the fetters of earth and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>
matter. As types of these three classes of men the
Gnostics gave the three sons of Adam; Seth was
the origin of the Pneumatic, Abel the type of the
law-abiding man, and Cain the picture of the earthly
man. Some of the Gnostics also classified the
three religions according to this scheme&mdash;Christianity
was the offspring of the highest God, Judaism
of the Demiurge, and, lastly, Paganism was a
product of earthly matter.</p>

<p>A by no means insignificant number of Jews
allowed themselves to be blinded by the uncertain
light of the new teachings, in which truth and falsehood
were so wonderfully commingled, and to
be thus drawn away from the parent body. The
secession of one man, Elisha ben Abuya, subsequently
had very sad results. The reasons which
induced this teacher of the Law, who was not
behind his fellows in knowledge, to fall away, give
proof of the important influence exercised by the
false teachings of theosophy on Jewish circles.
Legend has, however, embellished the story, in
order to explain how one who was versed in the
Law could take so strange a step as to despise the
Law. It is not to be doubted that Elisha ben Abuya
was well acquainted with Gnostic literature, as also
with Grecian songs, and with the writings of the
Minæans. It is also certain that he knew of the
fundamental doctrine of the Gnostics, which represented
God as a dual being, and that, like the
Gnostics, he despised the Jewish Law. He is also
said to have adopted practically the evil Gnostic
morality, and to have given himself up to a dissolute
life. Having thus fallen away from Judaism
he received, as a mark of his apostasy, the name
Acher (another), as though by going over to other
principles he had really become another man.
Acher was considered in Jewish circles as a striking
example of apostasy&mdash;as a man who employed his
knowledge of the Law to persecute it the more
energetically.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>
Against such incursions as were committed by
Christianity Judaism had to defend itself, in order
to maintain its existence and continuance. Inimical
powers thronged its Temple, desecrated the
holy things, dimmed its clear belief in God, falsified
and misapplied its teachings, turned away its disciples,
and filled them with hate and contempt for
what they had formerly honored. The time of the
Hellenists in the Maccabean period, who had first
brought dissension into the house of Israel, seemed
to have returned with renewed horror. Once
again sons conspired against their own mother.
The narrow circle of the Tanaites felt the danger
most severely; it hoped for nothing good from
the teachings of the Minæans, and recognized that
their writings exercised a seductive influence on
the masses. Tarphon (Tryphon) spoke of this
dangerous influence with the deepest conviction.
"The Evangels (Gilion), and all the writings of the
Minæans deserve to be burnt, even with the holy
name of God, which occurs therein; for Paganism
is less dangerous than the Jewish-Christian sects,
because the former does not recognize the truths of
Judaism from want of knowledge, whilst the others,
on the contrary, deny what they fully know." He
would therefore rather flee for safety to a heathen
temple than to the meeting-house of the Minæans.
Ishmael, whose character was less violent than that
of Tarphon, displayed the same feeling against that
Jewish Christianity which had shown itself so false
to its origin. He said that one need not hesitate
to burn the name of God in the Evangels, for these
writings only stir up anger between the Jewish
people and its God. Those who professed Christianity
were also reproached with seeking to damage
their fellow-countrymen with the Roman authorities
by tale-bearing and accusations. Perhaps by this
means the Jewish Christians sought to recommend
themselves to their superiors, and to show that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span>
had no connection with the Jews. Their contemporaries
therefore always considered the name
Minæans as meaning tale-bearers.</p>

<p>It is related as a fact that high officers of one
of the emperors, probably Domitian, came into
the school of Gamaliel, in order to find out
what instruction was given with regard to the
heathens. The Synhedrion of Jamnia must have
occupied itself with the question what position the
Jewish Christians should occupy in the Jewish community,
and whether they should in fact be considered
as Jews at all. There is no resolution of
the Synhedrion extant with regard to the Minæans,
but the regulations which were introduced with
regard to them give evidence as to its existence.
An actual line of separation was drawn between
Jews and Jewish Christians; the latter were placed
below the sect of Samaritans, and in some respects
below heathens. It was forbidden to partake of
meat, bread, and wine with the Jewish Christians,
as had been the case shortly before the destruction
of the Temple with regard to the heathens, and to
the same end&mdash;that of preventing closer intercourse
with them. The Christian writings were
condemned, and were put on a par with books of
magic. Even to enter into business relations, or to
receive menial services, was strictly forbidden, especially
the use of magical cures which the Christians
performed on animals or men in the name of
Jesus was prohibited. A form of curse (which bore
the name of Birchath ha-Minim) was likewise employed
against the Minæans in the daily prayers, as
also against the informers. The Patriarch, Gamaliel,
confided the composition of this prayer to Samuel
the Younger. This circumstance confirmed the idea
that the various ordinances against the Jewish
Christians, even if not proceeding direct from the
Patriarch, yet had his consent. The form of curse
appears to have been a sort of trial of faith in order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>
to recognize those who secretly adhered to Christianity.
For, in connection with it, it was decreed
that whosoever refrained at the public prayers from
pronouncing the curse, or from praying for the restoration
of the Jewish State, was to be dismissed
from his office of precentor. The Synhedrion published
all the enactments against the Jewish Christian
sects by circular letters to the communities.
On the part of the Christians the Jews were accused
of cursing Jesus three times a day&mdash;namely, at the
morning, afternoon, and evening prayers. This reproach
is quite unfounded, and, like many another
made against the Jews, is based on a misunderstanding.
The curse uttered in the prayers was
not directed against the founder of the Christian
religion, nor against the entire body of Christians,
but against the Minæan informers.</p>

<p>The separation of the Jewish Christian sects
from the Jewish community did not efface the
results of the influence which for a time they
had exercised. Certain Gnostic, that is to say
semi-Christian views, had found their way into
Jewish circles. Ideas regarding the primeval forces,
the æons, the predestined differences of caste
among men, even the teaching as to the two-fold
existence of God as a God of kindness and a God
of justice, had been adopted by many, and had
become so firmly fixed as to find expression in the
prayers. Certain expressions were employed in the
prayers which bore reference to the Gnostic or
Christian ideas. Forms of prayer as, "The good
praise thee, O God; Thy name is named for
good"; the repetition of the expression, "Thee,
O God, we praise"; the use of two names,&mdash;all
these bore a reference to the Theosophic theory,
which dwelt on the grace of God at the expense of
His justice, and thus endangered the fundamental
principles of Judaism. An impetus was given to
this train of thought by researches into the chapter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>
concerning the creation of the world, and the throne
of God as described in the Prophet Ezekiel,
(<i xml:lang="he" lang="he">Maas'se Bereshith</i>, <i xml:lang="he" lang="he">Maas'se Merkaba</i>). The exploration
of this dubitable ground gave full scope
to the imagination, and, with the assistance of the
Agada, allusions were detected and made to apply
to any subject, however far it might lie outside the
true meaning of the text. Researches into such
themes, the darker the more attractive, became
a favorite occupation; such profound meditations,
in the mystic language of metaphor, were called
"entering into paradise." Various teachers of the
Law are said to have been admitted to this higher
wisdom, but it was not denied that this occupation
brought with it many dangers for the Jewish religion.
These dangers are hinted at in the statement that
of those who devoted themselves to the study,
Ben Soma and Ben Asai brought upon themselves
respectively the one an attack of madness, the
other early death, Acher fell away from Judaism,
and Akiba alone fortunately escaped the danger, as,
in spite of his theosophic researches, he yet remained
on the territory of Judaism.</p>

<p>In point of fact Akiba had formed the purest conception
of God, of his rule, and of the duty of man;
and thus offered a sharp contrast to the ideas of the
Gnostics. He uttered a saying which is noteworthy
on account of its comprehensiveness and its brevity.
He said: "There is a providence in all things; free
will is given to man; the world is ruled by kindness,
and the merit of man consists in the multitude of
good deeds" (that is to say, not merely in knowledge).
Every word in this saying bears witness
against the errors of that time. As the far-seeing
Tanaites did not shut their eyes to the dangers
arising to Judaism from these inquiries into the
highest truths, they made preparations to avert the
same. Akiba especially insisted on placing boundaries
to the unregulated theories which led to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span>
falling-off from Judaism and to the wildest immorality.
He was of opinion that the passages concerning
the theory of creation and the cloud-chariot
of Ezekiel should not be expounded before the
whole people, but should be reserved for a few
chosen hearers. Those who could be initiated into
higher wisdom must have the knowledge to understand
hints and dark sayings, and, above all, must
have passed their thirtieth year. Akiba endeavored
to put an end to the study of literature which was
opposed to Judaism, by denying to those who took
part in it a portion in the future world, as was decreed
against those who denied the resurrection and
the divinity of the Jewish Law. The introduction
of such forms of prayer as bore the impress of the
teachings of the Minæans was wholly repressed.
These measures against the introduction of Gnostic
Christian theories bore fruit; the pure beliefs of
Judaism, with regard to God, His relation to the
world, and the moral conditions of men, remained
in Jewish circles untainted, as fruitful ideas for the
future. To the Tanaites of this period must be
given the credit that, like the prophets of old, they
protected Judaism from the falsehoods and errors
which threatened to overwhelm it. Following the
natural instinct of self-preservation, they, on the one
hand, shut out the Jewish Christian sects from the
Jewish community, and, on the other hand, strengthened
Judaism, and armed it with a strong power,
which upheld it in the storms which, through centuries,
threatened it with destruction.</p>

<p>Thus strengthened and concentrated, Judaism
was enabled to exercise some external influence. If
Christianity, which had sprung from such slight
elements, was proud of the vast number of Pagans
who had joined it, and given up their national
deities for the sake of an unknown God, Judaism
had yet more reason to be proud. A great part
of the conquests which Christianity gained in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span>
Pagan world were due to the Jewish religion, whose
fundamental truths and moral teachings had often
facilitated the conversion of the heathens. It was
only through the truths of Judaism that those
apostles who desired to convert the heathens laid
bare the inconsistent perversions of the Greeks and
Romans, for they made use of the words of scorn
employed by the prophets against the worship of
idols, and the immorality arising therefrom. But
Judaism celebrated its independent triumphs over
Paganism, which appear the more brilliant when
it is remembered that it lacked all the means and
advantages which facilitated the conversions from
Paganism to Christianity. The Christians sent out
zealous messengers, and, following the example of
Paul, sought to make converts by eloquence and
so-called miraculous cures. They imposed no heavy
duties on the newly-made converts, and even permitted
them to retain their former habits of life,
and, in part, their old views, without separating
themselves from their family circle, their relations,
or from intercourse with those dear to them.</p>

<p>With Judaism it was different; it possessed no
eloquent proselytizing apostle; on the contrary it
dissuaded those who were willing to come over, by
reminding them of the heavy ordeal through which
they would have to pass. Jewish proselytes had to
overcome immense difficulties; they were not accounted
converts unless they submitted to the
operation of circumcision; they had to separate
from their families and from the friends of their
youth in eating and drinking and in daily intercourse.
Nevertheless, it is an extraordinary fact
that during the half-century after the destruction of
the Jewish State, there were everywhere conversions
of heathens to Judaism, both in the East and
in Asia Minor, but especially in Rome. The question
arose as to whether the Ammonites could be
admitted to the community, or whether the Biblical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>
command with regard to the Moabites and Ammonites,
which forbade their admission into a congregation
of God, still held good. Further, a contest
arose as to whether proselytes from Tadmor (Palmyra)
could be admitted, the prejudice against them
being strong. An entire portion of the Law treats
of proselytes (<i xml:lang="he" lang="he">Masechet-Gerim</i>), and in the daily
prayers the true converts were included (<i xml:lang="he" lang="he">Gere-ha-Zedek</i>).
Several converted Pagans acquired a
knowledge of the Halachas. Akiba had two proselytes
amongst his disciples.</p>

<p>The greatest number of converts were to be
found in Rome, and this in spite of the hatred felt
for the Jews by the Romans. The clear-headed
historian, Tacitus, could not explain the fact that
the Romans of his time could submit to circumcision,
could renounce their country, disregard their
parents, their children and relations, in order to go
over to Judaism. The severe laws of the Emperor
Domitian against proselytes suggest an inference
as to their frequent occurrence. Josephus relates,
as an eye-witness, that in his time, amongst the
heathens, there arose great enthusiasm for Jewish
customs, and that many of the people observed the
Feast of Dedication (Chanuka), the Sabbath, and
the dietary laws, and that a strong feeling existed in
favor of the Jewish religion. "If each man thinks
of his own country and his own family," says Josephus,
"he will find that my assertion is correct.
Even if we do not fully value the excellence of our
laws, we should respect them, on account of the
numbers of people who respect them." Different
opinions were held as to the admission of proselytes
by the severe Eliezer and the mild Joshua. Whilst
the former held circumcision to be absolutely necessary
for admission to Judaism, the latter considered
a baptism, that is, bathing in the presence of qualified
witnesses, to be sufficient. The milder view
seems to have prevailed. Many of those Romans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span>
who joined Judaism, probably did not undergo the
operation. The historian, Josephus,&mdash;who, in his
"Apology for Judaism and the Jewish Race," and,
perhaps, also by his intimacy with the higher grades
of Roman society, endeavored to gain over the
heathens to the Jewish religion, and was, probably,
successful in his attempts,&mdash;did not consider circumcision
as imperative.</p>

<p>The pride of Judaism was the proselyte Akylas
(Aquila). He came from the district of Pontus, and
owned rich estates. Well acquainted with the Greek
language, and with philosophy, Akylas, at a mature
age, forsook the heathen customs in order to join
the heathen Christians, who were proud of such a
disciple. Soon, however, he gave up Christianity,
in order to go over to Judaism. This secession was
as painful an event to the Christians as his former
conversion had been a joyful one, and they spread
evil reports concerning him. As a Jew, Akylas
associated with Gamaliel, Eliezer and Joshua, and
with Akiba, whose disciple he became. The proselyte
of Pontus became strongly attached to Judaism,
and observed a yet higher degree of Levitical purity
than even the Patriarch. After the death of his
father, when the heritage was divided between him
and his brothers, he would not take the equivalent
for the idols which became his brothers' share, but
threw the money into the sea.</p>

<p>Akylas became celebrated through his new Greek
translation of the Holy Scriptures. The license
with which the Christians treated the old Greek
version appears to have awakened him to the
necessity of a simple but fixed form of translation.
As the Christians read the Holy Scriptures
at their service, and employed the Alexandrian
translation of the so-called Seventy (Septuaginta),
they were anxious to deduce from this text numerous
references to Christ. They changed various
sentences and added others, in order to obtain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
the desired prophecies about Christ from the
Greek text, which they held sacred. Several passages
may be found employed by the teachers
of the Church in confirmation of the teachings of
Christ, which cannot be found either in the Hebrew
or in the original form of the Greek text. The
Gnostic sects, for their part, did not fail to make the
needful additions, so as to give their teachings the
authority of the Bible. The school of one Artemion
is expressly named as having defaced the Greek
translation. The Jews, on the other hand, startled
at the alterations made in order to confirm the
Christian point of view, did not hesitate to introduce
changes of their own in order to remove all
apparent allusions to Christ. The Septuagint was,
therefore, the meeting-place for violent encounters,
and the traces of the contest are plainly to be seen
in the maimed condition of the text.</p>

<p>A good Greek translation of the Bible was likewise
a necessity for every Greek-speaking Jew.
At that time it was a universal custom to interpret
the portions read from the Bible into the
language of the country. On these grounds, Akylas,
who had a perfect knowledge of the Hebrew and
Greek languages, began a new translation, in order
to counteract the unlicensed violence done to the
text. For this purpose, while translating, he kept
strictly to the original Hebrew text, and with excessive
caution rendered word for word, without regard
to the fact that thereby the sense became incomprehensible
to the Greek readers. The literalness of
Akylas' translation, which has become proverbial,
extended to such particles as have a twofold sense
in Hebrew, and these ambiguities he desired to
retain in his rendering. He wished to make the
meaning contained in the Hebrew perceptible in
its Greek form. It was known in Greek as the
"Kat' akribeian" (the perfect fitting). This translation,
on account of its exactness, set at rest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>
all doubts, and comforted the consciences of the
pious. The teachers of the Law used it universally
for public readings. The Ebionites, to whom the
older translation was also objectionable, employed
that of Akylas in their services. An Aramæan
translation was made partly from that of Akylas on
account of its simplicity, and was called Targum
Onkelos.</p>

<p>A great sensation was at that time created in
Rome by the conversion to Judaism of Flavius
Clemens and his wife Flavia Domitilla. Flavius was
a cousin of the Emperor Domitian; he was also a
member of the Senate, and Consul. His wife was
also a near relative of the Emperor. Their two
sons had been named as Cæsars by Domitian,
therefore one of them would have become emperor.
What a brilliant prospect for the Jews that a near
relative of the Emperor Titus should reconstruct the
Temple which the latter had destroyed! Although
Clemens probably kept his adherence to Judaism
secret, yet it was known to the Jews in Rome, and
to the leaders in Palestine. On receipt of the news,
together with the information that a decree of
extermination had been passed against the Jews
residing in the provinces of the Roman Empire,
the four chiefs, the Patriarch Gamaliel and his
coadjutor Eliezer, the son of Azariah, Joshua and
Akiba, set out on the journey to Rome. When not
far from the capital of the world they heard the
thousand-voiced noises of the city, and were painfully
affected when they thought of the desolate
silence which reigned on the Mount in Jerusalem.
They shed tears at the contrast. Akiba alone
maintained his cheerful demeanor, and consoled his
sorrowing friends with the words: "Why do you
weep? If God does so much for His enemies, what
will He not do for His favorites?"</p>

<p>In Rome they were treated with great reverence,
both by the Jews and the proselytes, and they had an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
opportunity of answering many religious questions.
But they had arrived at an unfavorable moment.
Domitian was at the height of his bloodthirsty
tyranny.</p>

<p>The period of favor towards the Jews on the part
of the Flavian house was at an end. Even Titus,
Domitian's predecessor, had already wiped away
from his mind the recollection of all he owed to
them. His love for the Jewish Princess Berenice
he suppressed. When Titus became sole ruler,
Berenice journeyed a second time to Rome to
remind him of his promise of marriage; but she
came too soon or too late. Titus at that time played
the part of a reformed sinner, and wished to show
the Romans that he had put aside the past. He
banished Berenice from Rome, who, as was said,
left, but with a broken heart. Berenice personified
the relation of Rome to the Jewish people, who
were first in high favor, and afterwards cast into
banishment and misery. It is not known for how
long a time the Jewish Princess survived her disgrace.
Titus showed no more gratitude to her
brother, Agrippa II. He left to Agrippa his kingdom
or principality as it had hitherto existed, but
did not enlarge it as his father had done. Domitian,
the third of the Flavians, had no reason for
displaying any favor to Agrippa. When the latter,
the last of the Judæan kings, died (92), the Emperor
appropriated his territories, and made them
into a province of Syria.</p>

<p>Domitian, who, like Titus at his accession, had
promised to bring back a golden era, became, during
the course of his government, just as sinful and
bloodthirsty as Tiberius, Caligula, and Nero. He
was worthy of his nation and his times, of which
the poet Juvenal said&mdash;"It would be difficult to
avoid satirizing them." The Jews had to suffer bitterly
under this reign of blood. Domitian insisted
on the payment of the Jews' poll tax, and levied it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span>
in the most humiliating manner, and under circumstances
of peculiar severity. Severe, however, as
he was towards the Jews, Domitian was doubly hard
towards the proselytes, and suffered them to feel
the full weight of his tyrannical power. Those who
were accused of a bias for Judaism were, by the
emperor's command, dragged before a tribunal, and
if their fault was proved against them, they were
visited with the full punishment of the Roman law
against irreligion. Proselytes were, therefore, despoiled
of their property, sent into exile, or condemned
to death. Tacitus relates, in his inimitable
style, that executions not only took place from time
to time and at long intervals, but that they occurred
in continuous succession. At this time (95) Flavius
Clemens was condemned to death, Domitian having
heard of his leaning towards Judaism. Neither his
relationship with Domitian nor his high rank could
protect him. The four teachers of the Law from
Palestine, who had come to Rome on his account,
and who expected a brighter future from him, were
witnesses of his death. His wife, Domitilla, who
was exiled to the island of Pandataria, is said to
have declared to the teachers of the Law that
Clemens had been circumcised before his death.</p>

<p>Josephus, the Jewish historian, with his friendly
feelings towards Rome, appears to have taken part
in the lawsuit against Flavius Clemens and the
other Jewish proselytes. He stood in high favor
with the Emperor Domitian and the Empress Domitia;
but owing to the position which, during the
last Jewish war, he assumed towards the Romans,
he became so hated by his countrymen that constant
complaints about him were made to the emperor.
Once he was even accused of treason to Domitian
by the teacher of his own son. In his spare time
Josephus occupied himself with a comprehensive
work on Jewish history from its commencement to
the period before the war, and this he completed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>
twenty books in the thirteenth year of Domitian's
reign (93). With much trouble and at great expense
he had collected and used non-Jewish sources,
had brought them into unison with the historical
accounts of Holy Writ, and thus erected a national
monument, by which the deeds and thoughts of
the Jewish nation became known to the cultured
world. But soon after he erected for himself a
monument of shame. Justus of Tiberias, his former
enemy, had meanwhile written his history of the
Judæan wars, in which he represented Josephus as
an enemy to the Romans, a statement which might
have led to unpleasant consequences. Josephus
felt that his honor was attacked and his life threatened.
Not much was needed for the suspicious
tyrant Domitian to cast a man from the highest
grade of his favor to the abyss of a disgraceful fall.
In order to justify himself against the accusations
of his enemy, Justus of Tiberias, Josephus appended
to his history a description of the events of his own
life, describing his conduct during the war. To
clear himself from the imputations cast on him, he
represents his own character in a most unfavorable
light, as though he had always held with the Romans
and betrayed his own people. But in his fourth
work, published in 93 or 94, Josephus, though he
could not entirely redeem his character, yet clearly
evinced his deep love for his religion and his race,
and thereby earned for himself the thanks of his
people. In two books against the Greeks and
against Apion, he opposes, with deep conviction,
the accusations made against Judaism and the Jewish
race, and upholds the religious and moral superiority
of the Jewish law. These two books are probably
intended to win over enlightened heathens to Judaism.
Josephus points out with joy that many of
the heathens amongst the Greeks and Romans
already honored the God of Israel and followed His
laws. These books were dedicated to his friend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>
Epaphroditos, a learned Greek, who was strongly
inclined towards Judaism. No doubt Josephus
endeavored personally to win over proselytes. He
must have associated with Flavius Clemens, as he
lived in the Flavian palace. When Domitian carried
into effect the sentences pronounced against his
cousin Clemens and the followers of Judaism, it is
probable that a prosecution was commenced against
Josephus for having led them astray. A philosophical
essay concerning the laws of Judaism, which he
promised to publish in his last books, remained unwritten,
as his thread of life was cut short probably
by Domitian. The Jewish patriots, however, were
so embittered against Josephus that they did not
express any sorrow at his death, which was probably
that of a martyr. Nor was it referred to by the
four teachers of the Law, who left oral traditions as
to the death of Flavius Clemens.</p>

<p>A complete contrast to the character of Domitian
was presented by his successor Nerva. Just, wise
and humane, he was only wanting in the freshness
and courage of youth, in order to give effect to his
wise ordinances, and to restore the Roman empire,
shattered as it had been by Domitian's cruelty and
caprice.</p>

<p>The Jews and proselytes immediately felt the
effect of the change of ruler. During the short
period of his reign&mdash;which only lasted sixteen
months, from September 96, till January 98&mdash;Nerva,
who had to put an end to various perversions
and abuses in the constitution, yet found time to
occupy himself with the Jews. He permitted every
man to acknowledge his faith as a Jew, without
thereby incurring the punishment of an atheist.
The Jews' tax also, if not quite set aside, was
levied with kindness and forethought, and accusations
against those who avoided this tax were not
listened to. This act of toleration on Nerva's part
appears to have been of so great importance that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>
coin was struck in order to commemorate it. This
coin, which is still preserved, represents on the one
side the Emperor Nerva, and on the other a palm-tree
(symbol for Jews), with the inscription, "Fisci
Judaici calumnia sublata" ("Accusations on account
of the Jews' tax are at an end"). It is probable
that the four Tanaites, who were still in Rome at
the time of the death of Domitian and the accession
of Nerva, had furthered this favorable turn of events
by opposing the complaints against Judaism, and by
inducing those in power to form a better opinion of
it. This reign, which was of but too short duration,
terminated the period of favor shown towards the
Jews, and with Nerva's successor there began afresh
the old hatred between the Romans and the Jews,
and soon both nations again stood, sword in hand,
arrayed against one another.</p>

<p class="center bpad">96&ndash;138 <span class="smcap smaller">C.&nbsp;E.</span></p>

<p>Nerva had chosen the Spaniard Ulpianus Trajan
as his successor. This emperor, who was nearly
sixty years old, set about realizing his favorite
idea of annexing the territories lying between the
Euphrates and Tigris and the Indus and Ganges to
the Roman Empire, so as to win laurels similar to
those obtained by Alexander the Great. In the
Parthian lands he had an easy conquest; for this
ancient kingdom&mdash;partly of Greek and partly of
Persian origin&mdash;was torn asunder by the various
pretenders to the throne, and offered but little resistance
to the conqueror. Only the Jews, who lived
in great numbers in this district, under the leadership
of the Prince of the Captivity, possessed a
certain amount of independence, and offered resistance
to the Roman conqueror. The Babylonian
Jews beheld in Trajan the descendant of those who
had destroyed the Temple and condemned their
brethren to miserable slavery, and armed themselves
as if for a holy war. The town of Nisibis,
which had always possessed a numerous Jewish
population, displayed such obstinate resistance that
it could be subdued only after a lengthy siege. The
district of Adiabene, on the center branch of the
Tigris, obeyed a ruler whose ancestors, scarcely a
century before, had adopted Judaism. Mebarsapes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>
who was now on the throne of Adiabene, was,
perhaps, also inclined towards Judaism. He fought
bravely against Trajan, but was overcome by the
Roman forces. Trajan, unlike any of his predecessors,
witnessed after a very short space of time the
glorious results of his campaign. Conquests seem
to have met him half-way. When he withdrew into
his winter quarters in Antioch (115&ndash;116), in order
to receive homage, the chief campaign was almost
at an end. In the spring he again set forth, in
order to crush any opposition, and to carry into
effect the long-cherished plan of conquering the
Jews. But hardly had Trajan set out when the
conquered people on the twin rivers revolted again.
The Jews had a great share in this uprising; they
spread anarchy through a great portion of the
Roman Empire. Not alone the Babylonian Jews,
but also the Jews of Egypt, Cyrenaica, Lybia, and
those in the island of Cyprus were seized with the
idea of shaking off the Roman yoke. As if possessed
by an overwhelming power, the Jews of this
far-lying district seized their weapons, as though to
show the enemy that their power was not destroyed
nor their courage broken, and that they were not
willing to share the weakness and degradation of
the times, and to sink without an effort amongst
the masses of enslaved nations. Such unanimous
action presupposes a concerted plan and a powerful
leader. From Judæa the rebellion spread through
the neighboring countries to the Euphrates and
Egypt (116&ndash;117). In half a century after the fall
of the Jewish State a new race had arisen, who
inherited the zealous spirit of their fathers, and who
bore in their hearts a vivid remembrance of their
former independence. The hope of the Tanaite
teacher, "Soon the Temple will be rebuilt," had
kept alive a love of freedom in the Jewish youths,
who had not lost the habit of using weapons in
the schools. A legend relates that Trajan's wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>
(Plotina) had given birth to a son on the ninth of
Ab, and lost it on the feast of Dedication, which
the Jews kept in memory of the victory of the
Hasmonæans, and she had interpreted their sorrowing
as the hatred of an enemy, and their rejoicing
as joy for her loss. The Empress therefore wrote
to Trajan, "Instead of subduing the barbarians, you
should rather punish the Jews who revolt against
you."</p>

<p>In Judæa the leaders of the rebellion appear to
have been two courageous men from Alexandria,
Julianus and Pappus. The former seems to have
been the Alabarch of Alexandria, or his relative,
and a descendant of the celebrated Alexander
Lysimachus. He and his companion enjoyed a
princely position amongst the Jews. The meeting
place of the revolutionary troops in Judæa
was the plain of Rimmon, or the great plain of
Jezreel. There exists but a dim picture of the
proceedings, and only the issue of the revolt is
known with certainty. In Cyrene, whose Jewish
inhabitants had been encouraged to revolt against
the Romans immediately after their defeat, the
rebellion was at its height. They had a leader
named Andreias, also called Lucuas, one of whose
names was, perhaps, of an allegorical nature.</p>

<p>The Egyptian Jews, who in former times had
been loyal to the Romans, this time made common
cause with the rebels, and conducted operations
as in every other revolution. They first
attacked the neighboring towns, killed the Romans
and Greeks, and avenged the destruction of their
nationality on their nearest enemies. Encouraged
by the result, they collected in troops and attacked
the Roman army under the Roman general Lupus,
who commanded the legions against the Jews. In
the first encounter the wild enthusiasm gave the
Jews an advantage over the Romans, and Lupus
was defeated. The results of this victory were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span>
scenes of horror and barbarity on both sides, as
was naturally the case in a racial war between
people who carried in their hearts an ancient
hatred which, when it came to a fiery outburst, could
only be quenched by blood. The heathens who
had taken flight after the defeat of the Roman
army marched against Alexandria. The Jewish inhabitants
who could bear arms, and who had joined
in the revolt, were taken prisoners and killed
amidst fearful tortures. The conquering Jewish
troops felt themselves filled with a desire for revenge.
In despair they invaded the Egyptian
territories, imprisoned the inhabitants, and repaid
cruelties with fresh cruelties. The Greek and
Roman fugitives took to their boats, in order to
escape pursuit on the bosom of the Nile; but
armed Jews followed close behind them. The
historian Appian, at that time an official in Alexandria,
sought safety by taking flight at night, and
would have fallen into the hands of his Jewish pursuers,
had he not missed his way along the coast.
The short description of his flight and his unexpected
deliverance gives some idea of the terror
excited by the Jewish populations, who had suffered
so long at the hands of their enemies. The Jews
are said to have eaten the flesh of the captive
Greeks and Romans, to have smeared themselves
with their blood, and to have wrapped themselves
in the skins torn off them. These horrors are
quite foreign to Jewish character and customs,
but it is probably true that the Jews made the
Romans and Greeks fight with wild animals or in
the arena. This was a sad reprisal for the horrible
drama to which Vespasian and Titus had condemned
the captive Jews. In Cyrenaica 200,000 Greeks and
Romans were slain by the Jews, and Lybia, the
strip of land to the east of Egypt, was so utterly
devastated that, some years later, new colonies had
to be sent thither.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span>
In the Island of Cyprus, which had for a long
time previous been inhabited by Jews, who owned
synagogues there, a certain Artemion headed the
uprising against the Romans. The number of rebels
was very great, and was probably strengthened
by the discontented heathen inhabitants of the
island. The Cyprian Jews are said to have destroyed
Salamis, the capital of the island, and to
have killed 240,000 Greeks.</p>

<p>Trajan, who was then in Babylon, greatly feared
the outbreak of a revolt, and sent an army, proportionate
in numbers to the anticipated danger.
He entrusted an important force by land and sea
to Martius Turbo, in order that he might quell the
smouldering troubles of war which existed in Egypt,
Cyrenaica, and on the island of Cyprus.</p>

<p>In the district of the Euphrates, where the
Jews, notwithstanding the nearness of the Emperor's
crushing army, had taken up a threatening position,
he gave the chief command to his favorite general,
Quietus, a Moorish prince of cruel disposition, whom
he had appointed as his successor. It is not known
who led the Jews of Babylon. Maximus, a Roman
general, lost his life in the battle; Quietus had
received orders to entirely annihilate the Jews of
his district, so great was the fear and hatred of
the Emperor of a nation whose power he seems
in no way to have rightly estimated. Thus Trajan
had to oppose the Jews on three sides, and had
they united and mutually supported each other,
the colossal Roman empire would perhaps have
received a deadly blow. Martius Turbo, who had
to oppose the Egyptian and Cyrenean revolts, went
himself in his ships to the threatened spots, which
he reached in five days. He avoided meeting the
hostile forces in a sudden attack, coolly calculating
that this would only give the victory to a people who
were guided more by enthusiasm for an idea than
by principles of military tactics. He preferred to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span>
weaken the rebels by repeated onslaughts, which
gradually wearied them and thinned their ranks.
The Jews, however, did not submit without making
a brave defense. The heathen authorities, who
were against the Jews, acknowledge that it was only
after a contest of long duration that the Romans
became masters of the situation. It was inevitable
that the Romans should conquer in the end, as they
had greater multitudes and greater skill in war,
and especially as their cavalry had to encounter
only half-armed foot-soldiers. Turbo displayed an
amount of cruelty to the captives which was not
strange to the Romans. The legions surrounded the
prisoners and cut them to pieces, the women were
lashed, and those who offered resistance were killed.
The ancient Alexandrian synagogue, a marvel of
Egyptian architecture, a basilica, was destroyed.
From that time, says a Jewish source, the glory of
Israel departed. In the massacre which Martius
Turbo set on foot amongst the African Jews, the
same source relates that the blood of the slain
stained the sea to the island of Cyprus. This
refers to the sea of blood which the Roman general
shed amongst the Cyprian Jews.</p>

<p>Turbo, after the end of this African revolt, led his
legions against Cyprus. Concerning the particulars
of this war, authorities are silent. The contest,
however, must have been a bitter one, for a deadly
hatred arose in Cyprus against the Jews. This
hatred was expressed in a barbarous law, according
to which no Jew might approach the island of
Cyprus, even if he suffered shipwreck on that coast.</p>

<p>The war of destruction waged by Lucius Quietus
against the Babylonian and Mesopotamian Jews is
but little known in its individual features. Only
so much is certain, that he destroyed many thousands,
and that he laid waste the towns of Nisibis
and Edessa, which were inhabited by Jews. The
houses, streets and roads were strewn with corpses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span>
As a reward for the great services rendered by this
general in fighting the Jews, Trajan named him
governor of Palestine, with unlimited power, so that
he might suppress the revolt in the Jewish fatherland.
Trajan himself was unsuccessful in his encounters;
he had to leave Babylon, give up the
siege of the town of Atra, and relinquish the idea
of converting the Parthian land into a Roman province.</p>

<p>Through the failure of his favorite plan, the emperor
fell ill, and was brought to Antioch, and he
died a few months later at Cilicia. His desire that
his faithful general, Quietus, should succeed, was
also not fulfilled. His astute wife, Plotina, set aside
his last wishes, and assured the army that Trajan
had, before his death, accepted his near relation,
Ælius Hadrian, as his son and successor.</p>

<p>Hadrian, at his accession (August, 117), found
that various nations were on the eve of a rebellion,
and that others were taking measures to break the
fetters of all-powerful Rome. Hardly had the report
of Trajan's death been spread than the flames of
rebellion burst forth both in the East and the West,
and the wish of the nations to free themselves from
the Roman yoke, in a violent manner, made itself
known.</p>

<p>The Parthian lands, where Trajan had just established
the semblance of the Roman rule, some of
the districts of Asia Minor, whose agricultural
wealth had been appropriated by the officers of
the emperor, Mauritania and Sarmatia, and distant
Britain&mdash;all seized upon this moment of weakness
to strive for independence.</p>

<p>The Jews of Palestine, whose hatred towards the
Romans was yet stronger, had already organized a
rebellion, for the suppression of which Quietus had
been sent out by Trajan, after he had completed his
work in the lands of the Euphrates. He had not
yet succeeded in mastering the revolt when Hadrian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">400</a></span>
became ruler. Historians are silent as to the nature
of the war in Judæa. The Jewish sources call this
second rebellion "the war of Quietus" (Polemos shel
Kitos). It appears to have taken an unfavorable
turn for the Jews, for fresh signs of public mourning
were added to those observed for the destruction
of the Temple by the teachers of the Law. It was
forbidden that brides should wear wreaths on their
weddings, or that the Jews should learn Greek. It
is not clear whether this prohibition was directed
against the Greek language or the Greek customs;
as little is it possible to discover the connection between
this war and a distaste for what was Greek.
Perhaps the Greeks of Palestine became false to
their allies, and left the Jews in the lurch. The Synhedrion
of Jamnia appears to have been destroyed
under Quietus, but the Jewish people were soon
delivered from the merciless oppressor, whose plans
for their annihilation could not be carried into effect.
The new emperor himself put an end to his general's
career. Hadrian, who had more ambition
than warlike courage, and whose innermost aspiration
was for the nimbus of royal authority rather
than for a rough and troublesome military existence,
drew back at the prospect of so many revolts, and
from the chance of a long and wearisome war.
Already envious of the reputation of his predecessor,
with whom he had no sympathy, and
whom the Senate had been unwearied in granting
triumphs, Hadrian, for the first time, swerved from
the hard and fast line of Roman politics, and was
inclined to be yielding. In the same spirit, he permitted
the Parthians to be ruled by their own
prince, renounced all claims on them, and appears
to have made concessions to the other provinces,
and to have granted the Jews their apparently
harmless requests. Amongst these they expressed
a wish for the removal of the heartless Quietus and
the restoration of the Temple. The all-powerful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span>
general was deposed; and though the jealousy of
the emperor with regard to this great and powerful
ruler was a chief reason for his removal, it yet was
made to appear as if it were done to favor the Jews,
and to do away with their chief grievance. Before
Quietus fell into disgrace he was about to pronounce
sentence of death on the two Jewish leaders, Julianus
and Pappus, who had fallen into his hands;
they were to be executed in Laodicea. He had said
to them, "If your God is powerful, as you assert,
He may rescue you from my hands." To which
they replied, "Thou art scarcely worthy that God
should perform a miracle for thy sake, who art not
even an independent ruler, but only the servant of
one higher." At the very moment when the two
prisoners were being led to a martyr's death, the
order came from Rome which deposed their executioner
from the governorship of Judæa.</p>

<p>Quietus left Palestine, and was soon afterwards
executed at the command of Hadrian. The day of
the release of Julianus and Pappus, 12th Adar (Feb.-March,
118), was celebrated as a memorable event,
and the college appointed it as a half-holiday, under
the name of Trajan's day (Yom Trajanus). It is not
to be doubted that the Jews made the re-erection of
the Temple on its former site a condition of their
laying down arms. A Jewish source relates this
fact in clear terms, and Christian accounts positively
aver that the Jews on several occasions endeavored
to restore the Temple, and this can only refer to the
early years of Hadrian's reign. The superintendence
of the building of the town, Hadrian is said to
have entrusted to the proselyte Akylas. Great was
the delight of the Jews at the prospect of again
possessing a holy fane. Fifty years had elapsed
since the destruction of the Temple, just the same
period as had formed the interval between the destruction
of the first sanctuary and the return from
Babylon. The keenest hopes were aroused by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span>
Hadrian's assent. A Jewish-Alexandrian poet expresses
in Greek verse the feelings which filled
every breast. The unknown poet places his words
in the mouth of a heathen prophetess, the Sibyl, the
sister of Isis. She first recites, in enigmatic references,
the names of a long line of Roman conquerors
from the time of <span class="locked">Cæsar&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The great expectations formed with regard to
the restoration, which had appeared like a pleasant
dream, paled before the stern reality. Scarcely had
Hadrian taken a firm footing in his kingdom and
calmed the unruly nations, when, like other weak
princes, he began to diminish his promises, and to
prevaricate. One report relates that the Samaritans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span>&mdash;who
were jealous that the object of their
aversion, the Temple of Jerusalem, should again rise
from the dust&mdash;endeavored to represent to the
Emperor the danger of such a restoration; as their
forefathers had formerly demonstrated to the Persian
rulers, so they endeavored to prove to the
Roman emperor that the building of the Temple
was a mere subterfuge to bring about a total separation
from Rome. Hadrian, however, would probably
have come to this conclusion without the interposition
of the Samaritans. In any case, while he
did not venture wholly to retract his word, he began
to bargain. It is said by some that he gave the
Jews to understand that the Temple must be erected
on a different place from that on which stood the
ruins of the former building, or that it must be built
on a smaller scale. The Jews, who well understood
this temporizing, and saw therein only a retractation
of the imperial promise, were not inclined to let
themselves be played with.</p>

<p>When matters had reached this pass, many people
armed themselves and assembled again in the valley
of Rimmon, on the plain of Jezreel. When the royal
epistle was read out the masses burst into tears. A
rebellion and an embittered war seemed imminent.
But there were still lovers of peace amongst the
people, who recognized that a rebellion, under the
circumstances then existing, would be dangerous.
At the head of this party was Joshua. He was
immediately sent for to tranquillize the excited
populace by his influence and eloquence. Joshua
addressed the people in a manner which has always
appealed to the masses. He related a fable, and
drew a moral which applied to existing circumstances:
"A lion had once regaled himself on his
prey, but a bone remained sticking in his throat.
In terror he promised a great reward to any one
who would extract the bone. A crane with a long
neck presented himself, performed the operation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span>
and claimed his reward. The lion, however, said
mockingly, Rejoice that thou hast withdrawn thy
head unharmed from the lion's jaws. In like manner,"
said Joshua, "let us be glad that we have
escaped unscathed from the Roman, and not insist
on the fulfilment of his promise." Through these
and similar exhortations he prevented an immediate
outbreak. But the nation was filled with the idea
of rebellion, and adhered to it in a manner worthy
of a better fortune.</p>

<p>Joshua was the chief leader of the people in the
time of Hadrian, and appears to have performed
the duties of Patriarch, for Gamaliel had probably
died at the commencement of Hadrian's reign. The
honors paid to his dead body show the high esteem
in which he was regarded by the people. Joshua,
Eliezer, and his disciples mourned for him; Akylas
the proselyte&mdash;as was customary at royal funerals&mdash;burnt
clothes and furniture to the amount of seventy
minas. When reproached for this extravagance he
said, "Gamaliel is worth more than a hundred kings,
from whom the world gains nothing." A striking
contrast to this display was afforded by the simplicity
of the shroud which Gamaliel had expressly ordered
before his death. It was customary at that time to
clothe the corpse in costly garments, an expense
which fell so heavily on those of small means, that
many deserted their dead relations in order to avoid
the outlay. To prevent such expense, Gamaliel
ordered in his last will that he should be buried in
simple white linen. From that time greater simplicity
was observed, and it became the custom at
funeral feasts to drink a cup to the memory of Gamaliel.
He left sons, but the eldest, Simon, appears
to have been too young to undertake the patriarchate,
which, therefore, devolved on Joshua probably (as his
representative, Ab-bet-din). After Gamaliel's death
Joshua was desirous of abolishing various ordinances
which the former had enforced, but he was opposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span>
by Jochanan ben Nuri, who was supported by most
of the Tanaites.</p>

<p>It is hardly possible to doubt that the Jamnian
Synhedrion removed to Upper Galilee after the
death of Gamaliel, and Usha (El-Uz) in the vicinity
of Shefaram (Shefa-Amar), between Acco and Safet,
became the seat of the Synhedrion. Ishmael is mentioned
amongst those who emigrated to Usha.
Here the Synhedrion made various enactments of
high moral and historical importance, which took
the form of laws, under the title of Ordinances of
Usha (Tekanoth Usha). One of these laws decreed
that a father must support his young children&mdash;the
boys until their twelfth year, and the girls until they
married. Before this time the provision for children
had been left to the option of parents. Another
law enacted that if a father during his own lifetime
gave up all his property to his son, it followed, as a
matter of course, that the son must support both
his father and the wife of his father. A third law
limited the reckless devoting of the whole of a man's
property to charitable purposes, which custom prevailed
at that time. This law prescribed that only
a fifth part of the property might be given away.
Isebab, who afterwards died the death of a martyr,
was desirous of dividing his whole property amongst
the poor, but Akiba opposed him, referring him to
this law respecting property. One decision of
Usha seems to have been directed against Gamaliel's
severe employment of the interdict. It decreed
that no member of the College should in future be
excommunicated unless he actually despised and
revolted against the whole Law, like King Jeroboam.
This circumstance shows that the unity of
the Law was so established that a difference of
opinion no longer implied, as formerly, a total break,
and Joshua, no doubt, had contributed to this result.</p>

<p>The tolerable relations between Hadrian and
the Jews did not last much more than a decade.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span>
He could not forget that he had been compelled
to make concessions to the despised nation, and
the latter could not forget that he had broken faith
with them, and had deprived them of their fairest
hopes. This mutual antipathy displayed itself
during Hadrian's journey through Judæa. The
emperor, urged by vanity, and a desire to be
called the father of his country, and impelled by a
restlessness and want of occupation, which drove
him from one spot to another, had visited nearly
all the provinces of the great Roman empire, for
the purpose of seeing everything with his own
eyes. Hadrian's petty curiosity led him to concern
himself with all manner of things, to desire to be
considered as a philosopher, and better informed
than his contemporaries in all matters. Whether
he judged the condition of other provinces correctly
may be doubted; he certainly was deceived in his
hasty judgment of the Jews. During his visit to
Judæa (130), it is probable that those people,
such as the Romans, Samaritans, and Christians,
who disliked the original inhabitants (the Jews),
approached him with subservience, in order to greet
him as a demi-god, or even as a god. A pantomimic
conversation, which was held between a
Christian and a representative of Judaism, Joshua
ben Chananya, in Hadrian's presence, describes
their respective positions. The former showed by
gestures that the God of Israel had hidden His
face from the Jews; the latter showed, by a movement
of the arm, that God still stretched forth His
hand to protect Israel, and this pantomime Hadrian
desired to have explained to him. He seems to
have had many interviews with Joshua. Several
conversations between Hadrian and the Tanaite
have been handed down, of which one appears to
be credible. He asked him, "If you are as wise as
you assert, tell me what I shall behold this night
in my dreams." Joshua replied, "Thou wilt dream<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span>
that the Persians (Parthians) will subdue thee, and
compel thee to guard low animals with a golden
scepter." This retort was well chosen, for the
superstitious emperor feared the Parthians beyond
all nations, and did his utmost to maintain peace
with them.</p>

<p>Hadrian thought that he had nothing to fear from
Judæa. He informed the Roman Senate of the
peaceful disposition of the Jews, and they perpetuated
their credulity by various coins, in which the
emperor is represented dressed in a toga, raising
a kneeling Jew from his humble position. Three
boys (probably emblematic of the districts of Judæa,
Samaria, and Galilee) hand him palm branches. He
thus cherished the expectation that racial and religious
differences would soon disappear, and that
the inhabitants would merge their identity in that
of the Romans. In order to induce such a state of
things he drew up a plan, which could not have
been more unfortunately conceived. Jerusalem was
to be rebuilt, but as a pagan city. Whilst he
repaired to Egypt to commit other follies, the
desecration of the holy city was commenced. The
Jews naturally did not remain unmoved at this
act, which was to erase their name as a nation
and a religious body from the book of the living,
and a bitter feeling overcame them. Joshua again
appears to have endeavored to bring about a
reconciliation in order to frustrate the thoughtless
plan of the emperor, and to allay the discontent of
the people. Though an aged man, he traveled to
Egypt in order to induce the emperor to alter his
mind.</p>

<p>But his prudent suggestions were ridiculed; the
emperor would only mock at the Jewish, Samaritan,
and Christian religions, with which he thought
himself thoroughly acquainted. He wrote at this
time to his brother-in-law, "No president of the
synagogue (Rabbi) of the Jews, no Samaritan, no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span>
Christian priest, honors anything but Serapis. Even
that patriarch who has come to Egypt [probably
Joshua] was compelled by some to worship Serapis,
and by others to worship Christ." Joshua returned
to Judæa after his fruitless visit, and appears to
have died soon after of grief and old age. It
was justly said of him that with his death wisdom
and prudent moderation came to an end. After
his decease there occurred wide-spread movements
and contests in Judæa, which were among the most
memorable in its history, and there was no one to
stem the tide.</p>

<p>So long as Hadrian remained in Syria (130&ndash;131)
the malcontents did not commence the revolt for
which they had probably been long preparing. The
weapons prepared by the Jewish smiths for the
Romans were made (in anticipation of their being
used against themselves) weak and useless. In the
hollow chalk mountains of Judæa the insurgents
silently prepared underground passages and refuges,
which were used as secret armories before the war,
and afterwards as secret ambushes, from which the
enemy could be attacked. Akiba seems to have
developed a silent but effective activity in his
preparation for a revolt. After the death of Joshua
he was recognized as the head of the Jewish
community. Hadrian, lulled into security, discovered
the conspiracy only when it broke out at the
various points of the Roman empire, so skilfully
had the Roman spies been deceived. When the
revolt was about to commence everything was in
readiness. There were stores of arms, means of
communication, warriors, and even a powerful leader,
who, through his strange position, infused religious
enthusiasm and warlike courage. It was considered
as a favorable sign for their daring undertaking
that two of the stations of the Roman legions had
been destroyed. Cæsarea and Emmaus had been
swallowed up some years before by an earthquake.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>
Cæsarea was the Roman capital of Judæa, the
dwelling-place of the governor, and, like Rome, it
brought down the hatred of the Jews on itself.
The peculiar idea was entertained, that, as the
greatness of Cæsarea had dated from the time of
the destruction of Jerusalem, so from the fall of
Cæsarea Jerusalem would again attain to power.
Emmaus had been the dwelling-place of eight
hundred soldiers of Vespasian who had served
there; it therefore had been used as a second
citadel.</p>

<p>The chief hero of the revolt was Bar-Cochba,
who inspired the Roman empire in its then state of
weakness with as much terror as Brennus and
Hannibal had formerly done.</p>

<p>Not a trace, however slight, can be found of
the descent and early life of this much reviled
and misunderstood personage. Like the hero of
every revolution, he suddenly appeared as the
perfect incarnation of the nation's will and the
nation's hate, spreading terror around, and standing
as the center-point of an eventful movement. His
real name was Bar-Kosiba, doubtless from the town
of Kosiba, and was not a nickname meaning "son
of lies." Bar-Cochba was a symbolical Messianic
name which Akiba had given him. When Akiba,
actively engaged in the deliverance of the Jewish
people, first saw Bar-Cochba, he was so impressed
with the appearance of the man that he said, "That
is a Messianic king." Akiba applied to him the
verse of Scripture, "Kosiba has arisen as a star
(Cochba) in Jacob." Akiba was confirmed, by the
imposing personality of Bar-Cochba, in his hopes
that the Roman power would soon be overthrown,
and that the splendors of Israel would once more
shine forth, and he looked forward through this
means to the speedy establishment of the Messianic
kingdom. He cited the verse of the prophet
Haggai with regard to this (ii. 21), "Yet a little
and I will shake heaven and earth."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">410</a></span>
All did not, however, share Akiba's pious enthusiasm.
Jochanan ben Torta, a teacher of the Law,
replied dubiously to his high-flying hopes, "Sooner
shall grass grow from thy chin, Akiba, than that
the Messiah will appear." The respect and attention,
however, which Akiba displayed towards Bar-Cochba
were sufficient to surround him with a halo,
as of a higher God-given power, which gave him
unquestioned authority, and increased the means
at his disposal.</p>

<p>There is no record in Jewish sources of miracles
performed by the Messianic king for the gratification
of the populace. But an account of the enemy
relates how Bar-Cochba puffed forth burning tow
from his mouth to give himself the appearance of
spitting fire. The Jewish accounts speak of his
enormous bodily strength. They relate that he
cast back with his knees the huge stones thrown by
the Romans by means of machines on the Jewish
army. There is no hint given that he pursued any
selfish end by his Messianism; he was actuated only
by the wish to win back freedom for his people, to
restore the tarnished glory of the Jewish state, and
to throw off at once and for ever the foreign rule
which, during two centuries, had interfered with
the interests of Judaism. So energetic a mind,
combined with great military talent, even though
it failed to secure a favorable result, should have
received juster recognition from posterity, and certainly
does not deserve the prejudice which it met
with from interested contemporaries. The Jewish
warriors from all countries poured forth to aid the
Messianic king, and the revolt became one of
great dimensions. Even the Samaritans joined
their former opponents, as the chronicles relate.
Heathens themselves made common cause with the
Jews, impelled by a desire to shake off the unbearable
Roman yoke. It seemed as if the whole
Roman empire were about to receive a heavy blow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span>
by which the various members of its gigantic body
were to be rent asunder. From these facts the
number of the warriors cannot be considered as
exaggerated if the Jewish sources put them down
as 400,000, whilst the Pagan historian Dio Cassius
rates them even at 580,000. Bar-Cochba felt so
confident in his own courage and the numerous
warriors at his command, that he is said to have
uttered the blasphemy, "Lord, if thou dost not
help us, at least do not help our enemies, and we
shall not be defeated."</p>

<p>Tinnius Rufus, the Governor of Judæa, was not
prepared for the enormous military power opposed
to him, and he soon had to retreat before the
troops of the warlike Messiah. Rufus withdrew
from one citadel to another, and in one year
(132&ndash;133) fifty fortified places and 985 cities and
villages fell into the hands of the rebels. It appears
that the whole of Judæa, together with Samaria
and Galilee, were evacuated by the Romans, and
fell into the possession of the Jews. When Hadrian
received the first news of the revolt in Judæa, he
laid no great weight upon it; but when one report
after another of the defeat of the Roman troops
reached him, he sent relays and his best generals
to the scene of action; these, however, had no
better fortune than Rufus. It is not to be doubted
that Jerusalem fell into the hands of the Jewish
victors, who may have contemplated the restoration
of the Temple; but in the midst of the war, and
continually harassed by the Roman legions, they
had no time to undertake so extensive a work.
Bar-Cochba, in order to announce national independence,
performed a sovereign act of power by
causing Jewish coins to be struck. These were
called Bar-Cochba coins, and also coins of the
Revolution.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the deep hatred entertained by
the Jews for their enemies, they did not avenge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span>
themselves upon such as fell into their hands. It
was only against the Jewish Christians who lived
in Judæa that Bar-Cochba displayed his hostility,
because they were considered as blasphemers and
as spies. This hatred against the Jewish Christians
was increased because they refused to take part in
the national war, and were the only idle lookers-on
at the fearful spectacle. One of the oldest Christian
sources relates that Bar-Cochba had demanded
of the Christians to deny Jesus, and to take part
in the war with the Romans, and that those who
refused to do so were punished with heavy penalties.</p>

<p>When the State was restored and all laws again
came into force, the Jewish authorities felt themselves
justified in summoning those of their countrymen
before the justice-seat who not only denied
the Law but held it up to ridicule. It is nowhere
related that the Christians were compelled to recognize
and believe in Bar-Cochba as a new Christ.
Such compulsion seems to have been foreign to the
new Jewish State. Later Christian chronicles, in
their usual manner, have greatly exaggerated the
floggings to which the Jewish Christians were subjected,
until they assumed the proportions of actual
persecution, accompanied by death and martyrdom,
for which there is no historical basis. The Evangelists,
who, before the appearance of Bar-Cochba,
had spoken of the warlike preparations, and all
events of the time, in a veiled but perfectly comprehensible
manner, alone relate the position of
the Jewish population towards the Christians. They
seem to hint that even in the midst of Christianity
there was great dissension, and that some who were
eager for the cause of liberty, reported their more
indifferent coreligionists with much zeal to the
Jewish authorities. These Evangelists make Jesus
utter a prophecy which foretold a coming change,
as though he, amidst these stormy days, would appear
in the flesh at the Last Judgment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">413</a></span>
This prophecy of Jesus displays the gloomy tendency
of the times of Bar-Cochba. The words
run:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall
deceive many. And when ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars,
be ye not troubled: for such things must needs be; but the end shall
not be yet. For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom
against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places,
and there shall be famines and troubles: these are the beginnings of
sorrows. But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up
to councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall
be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony
against them. And the gospel must first be published among all
nations. But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no
thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate;
but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it
is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost. Now the brother shall
betray the brother to death, and the father the son; and the children
shall rise up against their parents, and shall cause them to be put to
death. And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but
he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus a father of the Church comforted the Christian
community in Judæa. It appears that the Synhedrion
of the time of Bar-Cochba introduced some
innovations in order to work against the increasing
spread of the worship of Jesus amongst the Jewish
Christians, and to promote a means of recognizing
those who were for them or against them. It had
been the habit for centuries past never to pronounce
the sacred name of God, IHW, but to substitute
the word Lord (Adonaï). The Christians, however,
had accustomed themselves to call Jesus "Lord."
To counteract this, the Synhedrion enacted that the
name of God should be used as in ancient times,
and that this name should be introduced even into
the formula of greeting.</p>

<p>The newly founded kingdom of Bar-Cochba had
already subsisted during two years (132&ndash;134). With
deep concern Hadrian beheld the continuous progress
of the Jewish revolution. It had taken a
course and an extent which opened up a vista of
unlooked-for results. Every auxiliary force which he
had sent to join in the contest suffered defeat, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">414</a></span>
every fresh general left his reputation on a Jewish
battle-field. Hadrian was obliged to summon his
greatest general, who at that time was repressing
the revolt of a nation who loved freedom equally
well, namely, the Britons. Julius Severus was recalled
to Judæa, as he seemed to be the only man
who could measure swords with the great hero, Bar-Cochba.
Severus, on his arrival, found the military
position of the Jews so secure and inaccessible that
he did not venture to give them battle immediately.
The chief stronghold of the Jews during this war
was the district around the Mediterranean Sea which
had for its central point the town of Bethar (Bither).
This fortress, the ruins of which are still to be seen,
is only one Roman mile (four-fifths of a geographical
mile) distant from the sea.</p>

<p>Besides Bethar, Bar-Cochba had fortified several
other towns, which were probably placed under
special commanders. In the north, at the foot of
the Galilean highlands, at the entrance to the great
plain of Jezreel (Esdraelon) there were three cities,
which formed a triangle of fortresses from the Mediterranean
to the Sea of Galilee. To the west near
Acco there was Cabul, or Chabulon; three miles
from this, towards the southeast, there was the
fortified town of Sichin, near to Sepphoris, in a
fruitful plain. About three miles further, to the
east of Galilee, and on the lake of the same name,
stood Magdala (Tarichæa). All three towns, Cabul,
Sichin and Magdala, are described as having been
densely populated, and they formed the outposts
which were to prevent the invasion of the Romans
on the side of Syria and Upper Galilee. The inhabitants
of Sepphoris appear to have secretly
maintained their devotion to the Romans, as they
had formerly done under Vespasian and Trajan.
Full confidence was not placed in them, but the
more reliable towns of the neighborhood were
chosen as meeting-places. A second line of fortifications<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">415</a></span>
was in the middle of the Jewish territory,
and was greatly favored by the conformation of the
ground. One of the chief fortresses which Bar-Cochba
probably again put in a state of defense
was Tur-Simon, doubtless named after Simon the
Hasmonæan. This fortress was also said to have
so numerous a population that, every Friday, three
hundred large baskets of loaves were distributed
amongst the army. Here, according to legend, the
revolt broke out, on account of an offense given
by the Romans to the inhabitants.</p>

<p>Julius, whose rapid glance no doubt perceived the
difficulty of obtaining a victory, owing to the strong
fortifications, the number of warriors and their fanatical
courage, avoided a decided battle, which would
have been desired by Bar-Cochba, who relied on the
number and devotion of his troops. Like Vespasian,
Severus purposely prolonged the war by divers
attacks. He reckoned more especially on the scarcity
of food which must inevitably ensue in a land-locked
territory, when the hands which should hold
the plow were engaged with the sword. He contented
himself with depriving the enemy of food, with
attacking the separate bodies of Jewish troops, and
harassing them with his cavalry. These tactics fully
succeeded, more especially as all prisoners were
immediately put to death.</p>

<p>The particulars of this revolutionary war were no
doubt as memorable as those of the war with the
Zealots, but no account has been preserved to tell
posterity of the death-struggle of the Jewish nation.
The heroic deeds of the Zealots&mdash;Bar-Giora and
John of Gischala&mdash;have been immortalized by their
greatest enemy, against his will, but no pen was
found to commemorate on the tablets of history the
warlike deeds of the last of the Jewish heroes. It
almost seemed that the remembrance of their
prowess, destined as the new generations were to
forget the arts of war, was to be totally forgotten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">416</a></span>
Only a few traits have been preserved to us of the
war, which bear witness, not only to the courage of
the Jews but also to their all-defying enthusiasm for
the cause of their race.</p>

<p>If, as the geographical position of Judæa demanded,
the first attack of the Romans was made
on the north, on the Syrian and Ph&oelig;nician side, the
three northernmost citadels of Cabul, Sichin and
Magdala must have been first attacked. The Jewish
sources which have handed down the details of the
war, as given by survivors, relate the manner of the
destruction of these three cities, and the circumstances
which led to their downfall. Cabul fell
through internal dissensions; Sichin through sorcery,
by which an unlooked-for attack was probably
meant; lastly, Magdala, the birthplace of the
penitent Mary Magdalene, fell, weakened through
the vices of its inhabitants. After the fall of the
three strongholds on the borders, the war was virtually
at an end, just as in the first revolution, after
the subjection of Jotapata and Gischala, the land
was considered as subdued. The plain of Rimmon
seems to have been another seat of the war, for the
Roman legions had to traverse this plain in order
to reach the interior of the land. On this plain a
terrible battle seems to have taken place, which
became the subject-matter of many a legend. The
next campaign of the Romans was evidently directed
against the cities in the mountains. Legend
relates how 100,000 Romans marched into the
citadel of Tur-Simon with drawn swords, and how,
during three days and nights, they massacred the
inhabitants. The fifty fortified places occupied by
the Jews fell one after another into the hands of the
enemy, and the Roman generals gave battle to the
Jewish army on fifty-two, or, according to some
authorities, on fifty-four occasions. The circle
drawn round Bethar, where Bar-Cochba and the
flower of his army had retreated, became ever narrower.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">417</a></span>
All fugitives had betaken themselves to his
side, in order to escape the sword of destruction
and to find a place of refuge. On this spot, where
the two greatest generals of the time&mdash;Julius
Severus and Bar-Cochba&mdash;were opposed, the decisive
conflict was to take place.</p>

<p>Bethar was, no doubt, filled to overflowing by the
contingents who came in from all sides. The sources
could not speak with sufficient hyperbole of this
final scene of the defense; they relate, amongst
other things, that several hundreds of schools existed
in Bethar, and that the numbers of the pupils
were so great that they boasted that they could
overthrow the enemy with their writing-reeds. The
siege of Bethar probably lasted for a year, and the
duration of the whole war was about three years and
a-half. We are left in uncertainty as to the various
incidents of the siege, as also regarding the
causes which led to the fall of the citadel. A Jewish
authority relates that the river Joredethha-Zalmon
faithlessly deprived the besieged of its waters, which
may mean that the summer heat dried it up. A
somewhat vague account from Samaritan sources
recounts that the food-supplies, which had been
secretly conveyed into the town, were suddenly cut
off; this agrees with the Jewish accounts, which relate
that Bethar fell through the stratagems of the
Samaritans. The Jewish sources assert that Eleazar
of Modin prayed in sackcloth and ashes that Bethar
might be spared; and perhaps his piety inspired
the besieged with endurance and courage.</p>

<p>Hadrian, or his general, being wearied with the
long contest, was about to raise the siege, when a
Samaritan promised to aid him, and told him that
Eleazar was the guardian spirit of the citadel, adding
that "so long as that hen cackles in ashes
Bethar is impregnable." Thereupon the Samaritan,
passing through a subterranean passage, approached
Eleazar whilst he was engaged in prayer, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">418</a></span>
whispered in his ear. The spectators, whose suspicions
were aroused by this secrecy, led him to
Bar-Cochba and related the incident. The spy,
when questioned, declared: "If I tell thee the truth,
my master will kill me; and if I keep it from thee,
thou wilt kill me; but I would rather die by thy hand
than by my masters." Bar-Cochba, suspecting a
traitorous understanding between Eleazar and the
enemy, summoned him to appear, and questioned
him as to his meeting with the Samaritan. Eleazar,
who had been absorbed in his devotions, and had
hardly noticed the Samaritan, could only reply that
he knew nothing of the matter. Bar-Cochba, who
thought that he was being deceived, struck Eleazar
a blow with his foot, and, enfeebled as he was by
fasting, Eleazar fell down dead. Then a voice was
heard: "Thou hast lamed the arm of Israel and
blinded his eyes; therefore shall thine arm and thine
eye lose their power."</p>

<p>The Samaritan sources describe the conquest of
Bethar as similar to that of Jerusalem. Hadrian, they
assert, who had laid siege to the city, had already
raised the siege, as the inhabitants had obtained
supplies, which they showed to the enemy. Then
two Samaritan brothers, who were held imprisoned
by the Jews, contrived to throw over the wall a
letter wrapped in linen to Julius, saying that if the
exits were guarded the inhabitants of the town would
certainly die of starvation. He followed their advice,
and entered the city on a Sabbath. So much
is certain, that the Romans, introduced by a traitor
into a subterranean way, massacred the people of
Bethar. This is described with fearful detail. Horses
were said to wade to the nozzle in blood&mdash;a river
of blood flowed into the distant sea, carrying bodies
along with it. One can scarcely credit the numbers
said to have been slain, and yet they are confirmed
both by Jewish and by Greek historians. The authentic
historian Dio Cassius relates that besides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">419</a></span>
those who died of hunger and fire, there fell half a
million Jews.</p>

<p>The loss of the Romans was equally great, and
Hadrian did not dare employ in his message to
the Senate the usual formula, "I and the army are
well." The Senate did not decree the Emperor a
triumph, but a medal was struck in commemoration
of the services rendered by the army. This coin
bore the inscription, "Exercitus Judaicus. Thanks
to the army victorious over the Jews." Bethar fell,
as tradition relates, on the 9th Ab, the date on which
the Temple had twice been reduced to ashes. The
end of the mighty Bar-Cochba is not known. One
who brought his head to the Roman General boasted
that he had killed him. His body, however, was
found crushed by a snake. On this the conqueror
said, "Had not God's hand killed him, a human hand
could not have injured him." Hadrian established
three military stations to capture the fugitives, in
Chamath (Ammaus near Tiberias), in Kephar Lekitaja,
and in Bethel. Whoever escaped the one
garrison was captured by the other. Thus all the
warriors were destroyed, all towns and villages laid
waste, and the land was literally converted into a
desert. The prisoners, mostly women and children,
were dragged by thousands to the slave markets of
Hebron and Gaza, where they were sold. There
were, however, some fugitives who lived in caves in
order to escape the enemy. But even this miserable
existence was not permitted to them. Heralds
announced that to those who voluntarily yielded
themselves up, mercy would be granted. Many
listened to the temptation, but were carried off to
the plain of Rimmon, and the victors were commanded
to massacre their prisoners before Hadrian
tasted food. Many fugitives, however, fled to
Arabia, whence that country obtained its Jewish
population, which afterward played so important a
part in its history. Hadrian also caused foreign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">420</a></span>
Jews to feel the weight of his anger, and imposed
on them a tax much heavier than that exacted by
Vespasian. In memory of this last revolt, the Jews,
as a sign of mourning, decreed that brides should
no longer be carried in beautiful sedan-chairs into
the houses of their bridegrooms.</p>

<p class="center bpad">135&ndash;170 <span class="smcap smaller">C.&nbsp;E.</span></p>

<p>Hadrian, who during the war had lived in a terror-stricken
condition, did not content himself with
merely crushing all revolt, but he desired to root out
the possibility of a future uprising. For this purpose
he caused a number of laws to be brought into
operation, every one of which was intended to destroy
Judaism, the spiritual life of the nation, in the
hearts of the survivors. Hadrian named Rufus as
the executor of his edicts&mdash;a man incapable of attacking
an armed foe, but more competent to carry on
a war of petty persecution and spying. Severus
having been sent back to Britain at the end of his
campaign, Rufus had the plow drawn over the
town of Jerusalem and the Temple Mount, as a sign
that another city should be built there. This occurred
on the eventful 9th Ab, perhaps a year after
the fall of Bethar.</p>

<p>Hadrian had the city rebuilt more towards the
north, where formerly the suburbs had been. He
populated the newly erected city with a colony of
soldiers who had served their time, Ph&oelig;nicians
and Syrians. The city, Ælia Capitolina, was built
in the Grecian style, with two market-places, a
theater, and other public buildings, and was divided
into seven quarters. Thus Hadrian succeeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">422</a></span>
in his preconceived plan of turning Jerusalem
into a heathen city. On the Temple Mount
a column was erected in honor of Hadrian, and
a heathen temple in honor of Jupiter Capitolinus.
Other statues of Roman, Greek, and Ph&oelig;nician
gods adorned, or rather defiled, Jerusalem. In all
public edicts Jerusalem figured under its new name
Ælia, and so completely was its identity forgotten,
that a hundred years later a governor of Palestine
asked a bishop, who said he came from Jerusalem,
where that town was situated. At the south gate
leading to Bethlehem a swine's head was erected in
half relief, as a special annoyance to the Jews, and
it was forbidden them on pain of death to pass
within the outer wall of this city. Hadrian erected
a shrine to Jupiter on Mount Gerizim, where the
Samaritans formerly had had their temple, a place
they considered as holy. On Mount Golgotha, opposite
Jerusalem, a temple was erected to Venus,
and in a cave at Bethlehem a statue of Adonis was
worshiped. Hadrian followed the old policy of
the Syrian Antiochus Epiphanes, who desecrated
the Jewish holy places from prejudice and revenge,
and endeavored to graft Paganism on Judaism by
force of arms. He thought most effectually to break
down the stubborn independence of the Jews if he
could succeed in weaning them from their peculiar
religious life. A decree was issued in Judæa which
inflicted the severest punishments on all those who
permitted themselves to be circumcised, to keep the
Sabbath, or to follow the Jewish law. Only in
one point did Hadrian differ from Epiphanes&mdash;he
did not compel the worship of the Roman gods.
All customs and habits which bore ever so slight a
tinge of a religious character were, however, interdicted,
such as the letter of separation for divorced
wives, marriages on Wednesday, and other customs.
This extension of the edict may have been a commentary
of the Roman authorities in Judæa, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">423</a></span>
were better acquainted with the spirit of the Jews,
and determined to enforce the imperial command in
order to attain the desired end. The weary years
through which Judaism passed, from the fall of
Bethar till after the death of Hadrian, were called
the epoch of Religious Compulsion, Danger and
Persecution. The stern decrees, and a sterner
enforcement of them, were a heavy blow for those
who remained. The more conscientious were undecided
how to behave in their critical position,
whether they should keep to the hard and fast line
of custom, or whether, in consideration of their
thinned ranks, they should save their own lives by
yielding to the exigencies of the moment.</p>

<p>There was probably no actual Synhedrion at that
time to take up the question and give them the
guidance they desired. The surviving teachers of
the Law assembled in a garret in Lydda, and deliberated
on this question of life and death. Amongst
the members present at this assemblage were Akiba,
Tarphon, and Joseph the Galilean. Doubtless
Ishmael, who resembled R. Joshua in character,
was also present on that occasion. There was
a difference of opinion with regard to this important
question. The strict elements appear to
have considered that every Jew, rather than become
guilty of the slightest infringement of a law,
however heavy (important) or light (less important),
should be ready to die the death of a martyr.
Ishmael supported the opposite view. He considered
that, outwardly and under compulsion, one
might transgress the Law in order to preserve one's
life, for the Torah enacted that its followers should
live by it and not die through it. The assembly at
Lydda, as usual, adopted the middle course, that a
difference should be made between important precepts
and those which were less weighty. The
matter was put to the vote, and the decision was
reached, that in order to avoid death by torture, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">424</a></span>
laws might be broken, with the exception of those
prohibiting idolatry, adultery, and murder. This
decision, which gives evidence of the desperate
condition in which the Jews at that time found
themselves, appears also to have contained a
secret clause, that in case of need the Law might
be evaded or neglected, but that it should be
observed as far as it was possible to do so. There
were many who obeyed, but who dissimulated in
presence of the Roman spies and overseers. It
was touching to note the petty tricks and pious
frauds by which they endeavored to avoid death
and yet to satisfy their conscience. The mental
tortures which they suffered daily and hourly made
them skilful in discovering loopholes of escape.
Even Akiba on one occasion when he saw himself surrounded
by Roman spies, gave a sign to his disciples
to say the Shema softly and almost inaudibly, for the
Roman authorities ruthlessly fulfilled the letter of
their edict. A Roman inspector (quæsitor), who
surprised a certain Artaban, as he was fastening
Mezzuzoth to the door-posts, compelled him to pay
1000 denars for this act. Another man, Elisha,
probably a survivor of the Essenes, was condemned
to have his skull broken, because he was putting on
Tephillin. It was dangerous even to wear the
Jewish garb. Two pupils of Joshua therefore
adopted the dress of the country, and when questioned
on the subject they replied, "that to oppose
the Imperial behest would be to commit suicide."</p>

<p>Ishmael describes this dreary time, when martyrdom
and death dogged their every step, in the following
words: "Since sinful Rome has inflicted severe
laws on us, disturbed us in the performance of our
religious duties, and especially prohibited the act of
circumcision, we really ought not to marry, in
order that we may not have children. But then the
race of Abraham would die out. Therefore it is
better that, for a time, the religious laws should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">425</a></span>
transgressed, rather than that a state of things
should be brought about which the people would
not submit to."</p>

<p>There were, however, many whose conscience did
not permit them to make use of the freedom permitted
by the Lyddan Assembly, or to employ the
subterfuges which were adopted by others. They
observed rigorously the religious precepts, even at
the risk of suffering martyrdom. One of the younger
witnesses of this sad time describes, almost in a
dramatic way, the ruthlessness of the Roman authorities,
who inflicted some cruel punishment for
each religious ceremony. "Why shouldst thou be
flogged? Because I used a lulab. Why shouldst
thou be crucified? Because I ate unleavened bread
at Passover. Why should ye be condemned to death
by fire or by the sword? Because we read the
Torah, and permitted our children to be circumcised."
Yet more terrible were the deaths inflicted
on the accused by the Roman tribunals, which
can only be paralleled by those inflicted by the
Inquisition. Red-hot balls were placed in the arm-pits,
or spiked tubes passed under the nails, or damp
wool was laid on the heart of one who was being
burnt to death, or the skin was taken off&mdash;horrors
which cause an involuntary shudder at their mere
enumeration.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the watchfulness of the Roman
officials, it would have been possible to deceive them,
had there not been Jewish renegades who betrayed
to the Roman overseers the various stratagems and
devices employed. These spies probably belonged
to an unscrupulous class of men, who would do anything
for gain, or they were Jewish Christians, who
by this means thought to find favor with the Roman
authorities, and to show that they were distinct from
the Jews. Lastly, there were those who considered
it a good work to assist in the destruction of the
Jewish Law. Amongst these was Acher, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">426</a></span>
imbued with contempt for the Law. It is said
that he gave information to the Roman authorities
to enable them to distinguish between religious ceremonies
and those which were of no moment. For
example, if the Jews were compelled to work on the
Sabbath, and one had to carry a load, in order to
ease his conscience, would get an assistant, and
thus lessen the desecration of the Sabbath, Acher
would draw attention to this ruse. Thus the Roman
spies, who initiated the overseers in the various
rites, were keen to notice every attempt at a
religious observance.</p>

<p>Hadrian or his representatives directed their
strictest attention to, and inflicted the severest
punishments in, two especial cases&mdash;the assembling
of schools and the ordination of disciples. It may
have been suggested to him that the continuance
of the Law depended on these two functions. If
the instruction of pupils by the teachers could
be stopped, and the ordination of pupils as independent
teachers could be prevented, then naturally
a stoppage must occur in the life-current of Judaism.
It must be confessed that the Roman policy was
well carried out by its supporters, and that they knew
how to strike at the most vital point of Judaism.
Severe sentences of death were inflicted upon those
teachers who maintained schools, and on those
who ordained disciples; even the communities were
made answerable for them. The town and its environs,
where an ordination took place, were condemned
to destruction. It is possible that Acher
instigated this persecution; at any rate, it is related
of him that he handed over the teachers of the Law
to death, and that he frightened away disciples from
the study of the Law.</p>

<p>Amongst the friends of peace who even advised
subservience to these decrees was José ben Kisma,
who honored patience as the highest virtue, and
hoped to effect more by submission than by bold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">427</a></span>
opposition and useless self-destruction. He once
met Chanina ben Teradion, who belonged to the
party who were determined to give up their life for
the Law. He was teaching his pupils from a scroll
of the Law, which he held in his lap. José said
warningly, "Seest thou, my brother, that even
Heaven is favorable to the Roman empire. The
Temple is destroyed; the pious are cut down, the
best men are exterminated, and yet this empire
exists! How canst thou dare to teach against the
Imperial law? It would not surprise me if thou
wert condemned to the stake together with the
holy books." José was in high favor at the court of
the Governor of Judæa, and when he died several
persons of high rank followed his body.</p>

<p>Most of the Tanaites were of a different opinion,
and decided rather to suffer death than to give up
their meetings at the schools; they considered it
of greater importance to study the Law than to
observe religious precepts. A special ordinance
was passed in the garret at Lydda that to teach
was far more important than to merely practise
the Law. As far as compulsory abstention from
religious observances was concerned, the teachers
of the Law had set an example of submission for
the time being; but in order to preserve the knowledge
of the Law itself they pressed forward to a
martyr's death, as though that must be the holiest
part of Judaism, to be defended even at the expense
of life.</p>

<p>An old account speaks of ten martyrs who bled
for the Law. But the names of only seven have
been preserved; of the others the accounts are untrustworthy.
The first to be executed was Ishmael,
son of the high priest Elisha, who formulated the
Thirteen Rules; with him was a certain Simon (of
which name there were several). Elisha was unwilling
to advise others to undergo martyrdom, but
he joyfully underwent it himself. Akiba gave addresses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">428</a></span>
in which he described how Ishmael and
Simon, both free from sin, had served as examples,
and fallen by the hands of the executioner; and
in conclusion he exhorted his scholars with these
words, "Prepare for death, for terrible days are
awaiting us." Akiba's turn soon came, for he
held discourses in secret. On the third day of
Tishri he was thrown into prison. In vain had
Pappos ben Judah, one of those who advised submission
at any price, warned him to give up his
meetings with his pupils, because the eyes of spies
were directed to the most secret places. Chance
brought him and this very Pappos together in
prison. Pappos lamented that he was only condemned
for a worldly matter, and that he could not
comfort himself with the idea that he was suffering for
a great cause. Rufus, the governor and executioner,
acted towards Akiba, whom he considered as the
head and leader, with even greater severity than
towards the others. He kept him for a long time
in the prison, which was so securely guarded that
no one could gain admission. The remaining
teachers of the Law, who felt utterly deserted and
helpless without Akiba, took all possible pains to
obtain his advice in doubtful cases. Once they
gave 300 denars to a messenger, who could only
with great difficulty obtain access to Akiba.</p>

<p>At last, however, the hour of his execution came.
Rufus inflicted the cruelest tortures on him, and
caused his skin to be torn off with irons. The
great martyr, whilst under torture, recited the Shema
with a peaceful smile on his face. Rufus, astonished
at his extraordinary courage, asked him if he was a
sorcerer, that he could so easily overcome the pain
he was suffering. To which Akiba replied, "I am
no sorcerer, but I rejoice that I am permitted to
love God with my life." Akiba breathed forth his
soul with the last words of the prayer which contains
the essence of Judaism&mdash;God is <span class="smcap">One</span>. Akiba's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">429</a></span>
death, which was as remarkable as his life had been,
left a terrible void. His contemporaries mourned,
for with him was destroyed the arm of the Law and
the source of wisdom. He left one son and several
disciples, who honored his name, and considered
his mode of teaching as the only permissible one.</p>

<p>The fourth martyr who heroically bore his death
was Chanina ben Teradion. Regardless of the
warnings of José ben Kisma, he continued to hold his
lectures until he was dragged to the tribunal. He
was asked why he had acted in opposition to the imperial
command, and he boldly answered, "Because
God has so commanded me." He was wrapped up
in a scroll of the Law and burnt on a stake of fresh
rushes. Chanina's wife was also sentenced to death,
and his daughter condemned to degradation.</p>

<p>The martyrdom of Chuzpit, the speaker (Meturgeman)
of the Synhedrion of Jamnia, and Isebab,
the secretary of the Synhedrion, are merely noted
without details; doubtless they were discovered
teaching the Law. Judah ben Baba is said to have
been the last of the martyrs. Before his death he
resolved to invest the seven remaining pupils of
Akiba with the necessary authority to continue
the propagation of the traditional Law. He
selected for the function the valley between Usha
and Shefaram, but despite this secrecy he was
surprised by the Romans. His disciples refused
to leave him, and it was only after repeated
entreaties that they fled. The enemy found the
old man alone, and he gave himself up to death
without opposition. He was pierced by lances.
From fear of Rufus's bloodthirsty vengeance, the
usual address was omitted at the funeral of
Judah ben Baba. Neither the name nor the mode
of death of the remaining martyrs is known with
certainty. Thus ends the second generation of
Tanaites; it was rich in great men, rich in great
minds, and rich in trouble and sorrow. The end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">430</a></span>
of Bar-Cochba's revolt formed the turning-point of
this epoch, and the fact that a temple to Jupiter
Capitolinus occupied the site of the ancient Jewish
Temple seemed to the Jewish Christians to presage
the last day and the return of the Messiah.</p>

<p>Hadrian and Rufus's cruel measures were directed
not against the survivors alone, but also against
the dead. The heaps of dead bodies were not permitted
to be interred, but the horrible sight was
intended as a warning to the survivors, that they
should no longer dream of deliverance from the
Roman yoke. The rulers did not trouble themselves
as to the pestilential condition of the air, or the depressing
effect of beholding so many corpses lying
in the sunshine; or perhaps they rejoiced that pestilence
and despair should be added to the horrors
inflicted on the Jewish nation. To pious and gentle
hearts the thought was unbearable that the remains
of those who had fallen, which were especially to be
honored by Jewish custom, should be left as a prey
to wild beasts and birds and to decay in the sunlight.
It appears that a pious man desired to
impress on the survivors who had made peace with
the Romans, and who lived in seclusion, the necessity
of interring the corpses in the darkness of the
night, even at the cost of their own happiness and
peace. To this end he composed a book&mdash;the Book
of Tobit&mdash;in which great weight is laid on the duty
of secretly interring the bodies of those whom the
tyrants doomed to disgrace; and at the same time
it was hinted that the danger attending this duty
would bring a rich reward. In evidence of this the
case was cited of the pious Tobit, who after suffering
many misfortunes as the result of his labor of
love, was in the end rewarded with rich blessings.
The contents of the Book of Tobit undeniably indicate
that it was composed in the reign of Hadrian.</p>

<p>Hadrian's severe persecution also fell upon the
Jewish Christians&mdash;perhaps on all Christians&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">431</a></span>although
they had separated from the Jewish community;
for the reason that the Roman authorities
did not consider the differences of dogma between
Jews and Christians. The Evangelists paint in the
darkest colors the horrors of persecution with which
the Christians were attacked. "Then you will behold
the terrors of desolation (predicted by the
prophet Daniel) where they should not be; he who
is in Judæa will flee to the mountains; woe to the
pregnant and to the sucklings. Pray, however, that
your flight may not take place in winter or on a
Sabbath."</p>

<p>Both sects of Christians were anxious to be recognized
as a body separate from the Jews, both politically
and religiously, so as to avoid the doom impending
over the latter. Two teachers of the
Church, Quadratus and Aristides, are said to have
handed to Hadrian a petition, in which they demonstrated
that Christianity had no connection with
Judaism. From this time dates the unity and identity
of most of the Jewish-Christian and heathen-Christian
sects. The Jewish Christians gave up the
Jewish laws which they had hitherto kept, in a greater
or less degree, adopting the dogmatic precepts of
Christianity as they had been developed under
heathen-Christian views, and as proof of their sincere
convictions, they for the first time placed an
uncircumcised bishop at the head of the community.
From the time of Hadrian all connection between
Jews and Christians ceased, and they no longer occupied
the position of two hostile bodies belonging
to the same house, but they became two entirely
distinct bodies.</p>

<p>Through the war against Hadrian and the edict
of persecution a terrible time had arisen for Judæa.
The towns were destroyed, the land laid waste, the
inhabitants were killed either on the battle-field
or on the scaffold, or led a miserable life as refugees,
while some were scattered in more hospitable
territories.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">432</a></span>
The disciples of the Law, more especially the
seven disciples of Akiba, had, with broken hearts,
sought refuge in Nisibis and Nahardea, and if the
persecution had lasted longer, Babylon would even
at this time have attained that importance for
Judaism which it reached a century later. Hadrian's
death, which occurred three years after the fall of
Bethar, brought about a favorable turn. The pious
beheld in the miserable death of this emperor, who,
next to Antiochus Epiphanes, became the incarnation
of the Jews' hatred, and the mention of whose
name was always accompanied by the curse, "May
God reduce his remains to dust," a divine visitation
for the evils he had wrought on the Jewish nation.
Those who had escaped destruction endeavored to
obtain from Hadrian's successor the revocation of
the cruel edicts. Titus Aurelius Antoninus, who
received the name of Pius, although the adopted
son of Hadrian, was of a somewhat more humane
and beneficent character, and a milder treatment
seemed likely at his hands. A noble Roman lady
of Cæsarea or Antioch, who had pity on the sufferings
of the Jews, advised them to petition the Roman
authorities that the persecutions might cease.
This lady was perhaps the wife of Rufus, and is
said to have had inclination towards Judaism.
Following this advice, a few men, headed by Jehudah
ben Shamua, repaired to the governor to beg for
mercy. In the gloomy darkness of their desolation
they lamented&mdash;"O heavens, are we not your
brothers, the sons of the same father? Why do
you inflict on us unendurable sufferings?" Such
lamentations appear to have induced the governor
to petition the Emperor to pursue a milder course
of conduct towards the Jews.</p>

<p>On the 15th Ab (August) the joyous news is said
to have come that the heaped-up corpses of the
Jewish warriors might be buried. On the 28th
Adar (March, 139 or 140), the yet more joyful tidings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">433</a></span>
came that the decrees of Hadrian were revoked,
and this day was commemorated in the calendar.
A Roman source relates that the Emperor Antoninus
Pius conceded to the Jews the rite of circumcision;
but they were not permitted to perform it on other
nationalities; that is, they were not allowed to make
proselytes. Thus the persecution on account of
religion was ended. Antoninus Pius, however, did
not repeal the law forbidding the Jews to enter
Jerusalem.</p>

<p>This unexpected end of the persecution recalled
the fugitives to their native land. The seven disciples
of Akiba&mdash;the only heirs to the spiritual heritage
of former times&mdash;who, for the most part, had
emigrated to Babylon, now returned. These were
Meïr, Judah ben Ilai, José ben Chalafta, Jochanan
of Alexandria, Simon ben Jochai, Eleazar ben Jacob
(or ben Shamua) and Nehemiah. They repaired
directly to the plain of Rimmon, made notable
during the Revolution, to consider the introduction
of a leap year, the calendar probably having become
incorrect. At the first meeting a fierce contest ensued,
probably with reference to one of the Halachas
of Akiba, but the dispute terminated in a friendly
settlement.</p>

<p>They reassembled in Usha, the native town of
Judah, which even previous to the revolution of Bar-Cochba,
had been, for a short time, the seat of the
college, and they invited all the remaining teachers
of the Law in Galilee to meet there. Many came
at the invitation, and the inhabitants of Usha endeavored
to provide the guests with all that they
required. The business of the Synod was to reinstate
and renew the traditions which had fallen into
disuse during the persecutions. After several days
passed in Usha, the chief organizers of the meeting
dismissed their guests with solemn addresses.
Judah thanked the strangers, who had taken the
trouble to come to the meeting from a distance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">434</a></span>
several miles. The other members of the council
thanked the inhabitants of Usha for the hospitality
displayed towards them. Thus did the nation,
whose destruction had seemed imminent, again revive,
and the Law was once again the curative
measure, bringing with it health and strength.</p>

<p>The members of the Tanaite circle pursued the
work of their predecessors with great self-sacrifice,
in order to restore the broken chain of tradition,
but their numbers were less, and their mental
activity inferior to that of the former generation.
The chief of those who took part in affairs were
Simon II., son of the Patriarch Gamaliel, Nathan
of Babylon, Meïr and Simon ben Jochai. The first
of these, as was related, escaped in a wonderful
manner from the massacre at Bethar, as also from
the persecution with which he was threatened. The
quæsitor, who had been appointed by Rufus to
imprison him, gave him a hint of the threatened
danger, on which Simon escaped and took refuge in
Babylon. How long he remained there, and under
what circumstances he assumed his hereditary
dignities, is not known.</p>

<p>Simon seems to have been desirous of raising
the dignity of Patriarch to special importance and
grandeur, probably in imitation of the Babylonian
Prince of the Captivity. He does not appear to
have been at the first Synod in Usha, nor to have
taken part in the discourses given there from time
to time, but to have taken up his residence at
Jabne, a place endeared to him by the memory of
his father, in the neighborhood of which he probably
owned property. The disciples of Akiba, the chief
supporters of the Law, appear to have preferred
Usha&mdash;or they desired to proclaim their independence
of the patriarch. Thus Simon, in order not to
remain alone, had to repair to the Galilean Synod.
The College was completed by Nathan and Meïr
as speaker. The patriarch had almost brought on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">435</a></span>
himself the fate of his father through disregarding
the equality which reigned amongst the members of
the College. Of his bearing towards the traditional
law only so much is known, that he taught the
universally acknowledged Halachas, and the doubtful
ones he had referred to himself. In contested cases
he gave the preference to former decisions, and
laid no weight on theoretical discussions. On the
authority of the numerous teachers of the Law in
past times certain practices had obtained amongst
their surroundings and had become an authority
amongst the people, and these practices Simon
desired to maintain. The decision of a court of
justice, in such cases where a mistaken judgment
was given, was to hold good, for otherwise Simon
feared that respect for such decisions would cease.
His high-mindedness Simon showed in the beautiful
saying, "The world subsists on three conditions,
truth, justice and peace."</p>

<p>The most original personage of this period
was unquestionably Meïr, whose great intellect,
thoroughness of purpose and knowledge remind us
of his teacher Akiba. His real but forgotten name
was Miasa or Moise (the Greek for Moses). According
to an unauthenticated legend he was said to be
descended from a converted family, from the Emperor
Nero in fact, who was believed in the East to
have escaped his murderers and to have become
converted to Judaism.</p>

<p>It is certain that Meïr's birthplace was in Asia
Minor, probably in the Cappadocian Cæsarea. He
made his livelihood through writing and copying
Holy Writ. He was so intimately acquainted with
the orthographical rules of the Hebrew language,
which render the transcription of the Holy Books
almost a science, that he once wrote from memory
the whole book of Esther without making a mistake.
By this means he earned three shekels per week,
two-thirds of which he devoted to his family and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">436</a></span>
one-third to the support of poor fellow-students.
He married Bruria (or Valeria), the learned
daughter of Chanina ben Teradion, whose Halachic
knowledge was praised even by Joshua. Meïr was
for a time a pupil of Ishmael, but his simple mode
of teaching did not please him so well as the more
intelligent method of Akiba, whose system, which
was ultimately adopted by him, exercised the most
decided influence over his mode of thought. Akiba
soon ordained his favorite pupil, and gave him the
preference over Simon, but on account of his youth
he did not meet with much respect as an independent
teacher. Meïr was severe on such petty conduct,
which did not look to the qualifications of a man,
but to his age. "Look not," he said wittily, "to
the vessel, but to its contents. Many a new vessel
contains old wine, but there are old casks which do
not contain even new wine." Several sensible
sayings are recorded of him; he became celebrated
as a writer of fables, and composed 300 on the fox
alone&mdash;a favorite subject of Eastern imagery. The
submission to God of Meïr and his wife on the
occasion of the death of their two children has
become known through a poetical account of the
event. It is related that his two sons, having died
suddenly on the Sabbath, during their father's
absence at the school, his tender-hearted wife did
not tell him of the deaths, in order that he might
not be grieved by sad tidings on the holy day.
When the Sabbath was over she asked him whether
that which was lent must necessarily be returned to
the lender, and on receiving an affirmative answer
she led him to where their two children lay dead,
and consoled him with what he had said, that they
had only been confided to their care, and were now
reclaimed by the owner. Meïr's modesty was as
great as his submissiveness to God. His favorite
saying was, "Occupy thyself less with gain than
with the Law, and be humble to all men."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">437</a></span>
His contemporaries and successors could not
sufficiently praise Meïr's wisdom and character.
José depicts him to his townspeople, the inhabitants
of Sepphoris, as a pious, morally strict and holy
man. It became proverbial that "He who touches
Meïr's staff becomes wise." He obtained his deep
knowledge of men by mixing with those against
whom prejudice prevailed. He even sought out
the apostate and traitor Acher, in order that he
might be instructed by him. When Meïr was
reproached for his intimacy with a traitor to the
Law, he said, "When I see a juicy pomegranate I
enjoy its contents and throw away the skin."</p>

<p>One Sabbath he accompanied Acher, who was
on horseback, whilst Meïr was on foot, discussing a
rendering of the Scriptures. Suddenly Acher said
to him, "Thou canst go thus far and not farther,
for here is the limit of thy Sabbath walk. Return."
Meïr, seizing the opportunity, said to Acher,
"Return thou also." But Acher said, "If for all
sinners there be pardon, for me the gates of mercy
are closed, because I have turned the gifts given
me by God to evil uses." Later, when Acher was
ill, Meïr again endeavored to win him over, and
flattered himself that he had induced Acher to
repent before his death. A legend relates that
Meïr spread his mantle over Acher's grave, from
which there arose a pillar of smoke, and in imitation
of a verse of Scripture (Ruth iii. 13) he exclaimed,
"Rest here in the night; in the dawn of happiness
the God of mercy will deliver thee; if not, I will be
thy redeemer."</p>

<p>Meïr also was intimate with a heathen philosopher,
Euonymus of Gadara. In Jewish circles it was said,
"Be not surprised to find amongst the heathens a
knowledge of God, for God had inspired Balaam
and Euonymus, two of the greatest philosophers of
heathendom, with His wisdom, so that they might
teach the people." When Euonymus mourned for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">438</a></span>
the death of his parents, Meïr visited him in order
to condole with him, for he held that a heathen who
occupied himself with the Torah was as worthy as
a high priest of Judaism, for it says in Holy Writ,
"These laws man shall observe in order to live," by
which Meïr explained that Jews were not exclusively
appointed to enjoy eternal happiness.</p>

<p>Through intercourse with men of learning Meïr
appears to have become acquainted with the Stoic
philosophy, which was at that time the ruling power
in the Roman world. But all the perfections which,
according to philosophy, were due to the Stoic
theory, he attributed to the Torah, which helps man
to attain the ideal, if he devotes himself to it from
pure love and without interested motives. "The
Torah," he says, "makes him who familiarizes himself
with it worthy to all the world; he becomes the
favorite of all; it inspires him with love to God and
man; clothes him in modesty and fear of God;
makes him pious, honest, and true; removes him
from sin; brings him near to virtue; endows him
with kingly dignity; makes him moral, long-suffering,
forgetful of injury, and raises and carries him above
all things." This was his ideal of a truly wise man.
In treating the Halachic traditions Meïr copied his
teacher Akiba's system of dialectics. The rules of
deduction used by his predecessors he employed as
formulas which could establish or abolish legal
enactments. His contemporaries relate of him that
they could never reach the real meaning of Meïr's
decisions, because he brought forward a number of
proofs for and against an ordinance, and he was
able through similes and deductions to turn a law,
as it was laid down, into one of an opposite meaning.
Whether these sophistic arguments were to be
taken seriously, or whether they were only intended
by the speaker for dialectic purposes in order to
show both sides of the question, is not now known, as
even those who lived in former times were doubtful
on the subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">439</a></span>
Yet the injurious method of treating the Halachas,
which was called Talmudic dialectics, became
later on still more developed; in fact, the closer
apprehension of the Halachas was deemed impossible
without it. Nevertheless, Meïr's exposition
of the Law was decidedly serious and strict.
Amongst other things he asserts that he who gives
his wife less dowry than is usual, acts wrongly; for
he thereby makes divorce more easy to obtain.
Further, he asserts that any one who in the smallest
degree should deviate from the law laid down for
divorce would render the act illegal, and his children
from the second marriage would be considered as
illegitimate. Meïr further controverted the law which
was universally respected, that what was forbidden or
permitted should be inferred from such cases as most
commonly occurred in life, without regard to exceptional
circumstances; he considered that certain
circumstances should conscientiously be reckoned
exceptional. For this reason when he heard that
some Samaritans continued to worship idols, which
according to Hadrian's edict they had formerly
been compelled to do, when they brought him
libations of wine, he refused to permit the use of
wine amongst his hearers. This abstinence, had it
been consistently observed, would have put an end
to much industry and pleasure and rendered them
legally impossible. For other misdeeds, as for
example usury, he imposed heavy fines. But his
regulations were not carried out, his contemporaries
and succeeding generations did not acknowledge
Meïr's ordinances and imposts in their entirety.
He was, however, most severe against himself, and
once said&mdash;"Even if I hold something as permissible
to others, I cannot allow it to hold good for myself,
if I am convinced that my colleagues would be of a
different opinion." As in the treatment of Halachas,
so in ordinary things, Meïr followed in the footsteps
of Akiba; he completed the collection of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">440</a></span>
Mishnas, but appears to have arranged their component
parts more according to their contents than
their number. These arrangements of Meïr and his
colleagues made no pretense to being a code, but
each teacher of the Law having a circle of disciples,
treated the material before him in the manner
which seemed most suitable and convenient to
himself. Meïr had assembled a not insignificant
number of pupils round him, who were drawn
towards him by his intelligent renderings and interesting
lectures. He was in the habit of alternating
the dry matter of the Halachas with the attractive
Agadahs, and of illustrating them by fables.</p>

<p>Amongst Meïr's disciples was one named Symmachos
ben Joseph, who adopted and exaggerated
his method to such an extent that it was said of him
that he could argue well, but could not come to any
practical decision. It was even said of him that his
forefathers could not have been present at the Revelation
on Sinai. After Meïr's death both Symmachos
and his disciples were excluded from the
school, because they did not seek for truth, but only
to dispute sophistically. It is probable that Meïr
repaired to the Synhedrion of Usha when important
questions were under discussion. He did not live
on good terms with the Patriarch Simon.</p>

<p>Simon ben Jochai of Galilee was as striking but
not so many-sided a personage as Meïr, and he
was falsely reported to be a worker of miracles&mdash;a
mystic and a Cabbalist. Few facts of his life are
known, but we may infer from what is recorded
that he was rather of a matter-of-fact than of an
imaginative turn of mind. Nothing is known of
Simon's youth, and later, after his return with others
from the exile imposed on them under Hadrian's
rule, his activity seems to have spent itself on the
newly organized Synhedrion at Usha. In opposition
to his father, Jochai, who stood in favor with the
Roman authorities, the son was a decided enemy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">441</a></span>
of Rome, and was not much liked by them. For
uttering a truthful censure on the Roman Governor,
he was sentenced to death, and could save himself
only by flight, and upon this fact legend has seized
in order to surround Simon with wonders and
miracles. Amongst the various legal decisions,
sayings and remarks which have been preserved of
him there is no trace of a mystical tendency. On
the contrary his reasoning with regard to biblical
laws was always of a simple nature. The system
of following out the reasoning of the Law, and
thence drawing deductions, was peculiar to Simon.</p>

<p>This was an improvement on Akiba's system, which
consisted in drawing from pleonastic words, syllables
and letters, the principles of legal deductions.
The following are instances of Simon's method.
The Bible forbids the distraint of a widow's goods;
Simon restricted the reference to cases of poor
widows. Simon drew his conclusion in the following
manner:&mdash;The biblical law which enacts that a widow
should be spared all legal seizure of goods could
only apply to poor widows. A rich woman had no
cause for being so spared. Further, that the prohibition
against intermarrying with the seven Canaanite
races must also be extended to all idolatrous
nations, as the law was actually intended to
prevent the people from being drawn into idolatry.</p>

<p>Another opinion of Simon's shows how far removed
he was from all exaggerated religious theories.
He had a curious saying that the fulfilment
of the Law was only possible to those who lived on
manna or the tithes. Unlike most teachers of the
Law, Simon pursued no occupation or business; he
was at that time the only man whose life's business
was the study of the Law. Simon's dwelling-place
and school-house were in the fertile oil district of
Tekoa, in Galilee. He had his circle of disciples,
and because he survived his colleagues he became
the only authority of the following period.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">442</a></span>
Another important name was that of Judah ben
Ilai of Usha, whose character bore a similarity to
that of Joshua. Modest, wise, diplomatic, eloquent,
he knew how to bridge over the breach which existed
between the Roman and the Jewish nature.
He was therefore especially designated "the wise,"
or "the first speaker." Judah was not a man of
property, but, like Joshua, he supported himself by
an occupation of which he was not ashamed. He
often used the expression&mdash;"The work honors the
laborer. He who does not teach his son a handicraft
designs him to be a robber." His mode
of teaching had no especially pronounced characteristics.</p>

<p>As with Judah we have no distinctive features recorded,
so also of the life of José ben Chalafta of
Sepphoris but little is known. He also followed a
trade, and one of the lowest kind. He was a worker
in leather. Unlike his contemporaries, José devoted
himself to the collection of the annals of Jewish history,
and left an account from the creation of the
world to the war of Bar Cochba, under the name
of Seder Olam. He endeavored to fix the various
dates correctly from the historical records of the
Bible. He tried to render clear the doubtful passages,
and to fill up the gaps in traditions. On
the other hand, from the time of Alexander the
Great, we find that this chronicle of José gives
independent and trustworthy, but very scanty information.</p>

<p>But little that is noteworthy is known of the other
disciples of Akiba. Besides the Galilean circle of
scholars there was yet another in the extreme south
of Judæa (Darom) who continued Ishmael's mode
of teaching; only two members of this circle, Josiah
and Jonathan, are known.</p>

<p>Nathan, a Babylonian, and a son of the Prince of
the Captivity, was a man of special interest. It is
not known where he received instruction in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">443</a></span>
Halachas, nor what occasioned him to remove to
Judæa, or to give up the more favorable position
that he occupied in his native country. The foreign
teachers of the Law at this period were Judah ben
Bathyra of Nisibis, who appears to have sheltered
the fugitives from Judæa; also Chananya, nephew
of Joshua, in Nahar-Pakod, who had been sent by
his uncle to Babylon, so as to remove him from the
influence of the Jewish Christians; and, lastly,
Matiah ben Charash in Rome, who first transplanted
the knowledge of the Jewish Law from Asia
to Europe.</p>

<p>Whilst the teachers of the Law in Galilee endeavored
to reanimate the body of the nation, to re-establish
the Synhedrion, and to secure and spread
traditions by collecting and classifying them, but
little was needed to cause a deep schism which
threatened to separate the Babylonian congregation
entirely from the main body.</p>

<p>The wisdom of the Patriarch Simon II. deftly
avoided this breach. Chananya established a sort of
Synhedrion in Nahar-Pakod, probably in the neighborhood
of Nahardea, of which he was the president,
whilst a certain Nechunyan, perhaps the Prince of
the Captivity, appears to have supported him. The
Babylonian community, until then under the control
of Judæa, and now left uncared for through
the destruction of all religious institutions in the
fatherland, welcomed a Synhedrion in their midst as
of joyful import, and gratefully accepted its ordinances
and decisions. Chananya immediately introduced
a leap year, and the celebration of the
festivals as had been customary in Judæa. But
when the Synhedrion had been established in Usha
it was no longer possible to continue the existence
of a body which threatened the unity of Judaism,
and tended to divide it into an eastern and western
Judaism. In order to avoid such a division the
Patriarch Simon sent two ambassadors, Isaac and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">444</a></span>
Nathan, with flattering messages to Chananya, with
the unusual superscription, "To his holiness Chananya."
The president of the Babylonian Synhedrion,
who had not expected such friendliness, received
the Jewish ambassadors in the kindest manner,
and introduced them with flattering speeches
to the assembly. Having secured the confidence
of the nation, they named the ultimate reason of
their embassage. At the public service they read
from the Book of Laws, "Such are the feast days of
Chananya" (instead of God). Another read from
the prophets&mdash;"From Babylon shall the light go
forth, and the word of the Lord from Nahar Pakod"
(instead of Zion and Jerusalem). The audience,
whose attention was drawn through these ironical
allusions, and who felt that an independent Synhedrion
in Babylon would be contrary to the spirit of
the Law, felt their consciences disturbed. Chananya
vainly endeavored to weaken the impression by implicating
the ambassadors. They replied that to
establish an opposition Synhedrion in Babylon was
tantamount to building an altar, at which Chananya
and Nechunya would officiate as unauthorized
priests, and was in fact equal to disavowing the God
of Israel. Chananya, however, doubted the continuance
of a Synhedrion in Judæa, saying that the
teachers of the Law there did not enjoy any authority,
to which the ambassadors replied, "The little ones
whom thou hast deserted have meanwhile grown
up." Chananya, however, did not relinquish his
design until Judah ben Bathyra, in Nisibis, pointed
out to him that in holy things unqualified obedience
must be paid to the Judæan Synhedrion. Finding
no response or interest anywhere, he countermanded
the festivals as arranged by himself, and the Babylonian
Synhedrion came to an end.</p>

<p>Dissensions arose at the College of Usha, which
threatened to have similar results to the contest between
Gamaliel and Joshua. The Patriarch Simon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">445</a></span>
in order to increase his dignity, endeavored to introduce
a special etiquette, in order to remove the
equality previously existing between all officials. In
the absence of the Ab-beth-din Nathan and the
speaker Meïr, he instituted a new order of rank,
which would definitely recognize him as the superior
head. This distinction lay herein, that at all public
sittings of the Synhedrion the people, who were accustomed
to rise at the entrance of the president
and other important officials, and to remain standing
until the sign was given them to be seated, should
reserve this mark of honor in future for the President
alone; in honor of his substitute only the first
rows were to stand until he had taken his seat; and
still less ceremony was to be observed towards the
speaker (the Chacham).</p>

<p>When Nathan and Meïr for the first time attended
the meeting and noticed the new arrangements they
secretly determined to conspire against Simon, and
to deprive him of his office. For this purpose, however,
the consent of the nation, with whom the appointment
of Patriarch rested, became necessary.
They determined to puzzle Simon by difficult questions
(on the Halachas), and he seems to have been
inferior to them in knowledge of traditional lore,
and when they had revealed his weakness before
the whole assemblage they intended proposing the
deposition of a Patriarch who was not conversant
with all branches of the Law. They also determined
that Nathan, who belonged to the family of the
Prince of the Captivity, and who was also of the
race of David, should become Patriarch, and that
Meïr should be second in rank as substitute. This
plot, however, was betrayed to Simon, and the conspirators
found him prepared.</p>

<p>The Patriarch, on revealing the scheme against
him, succeeded in having the two expelled from the
Synhedrion. But they made their absence felt by
writing difficult questions and distributing them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">446</a></span>
amongst the assembly, whom they thereby placed
in an awkward position. Referring to these two
José afterwards said, "We are in the house of the
Law, but the Law is outside." They were readmitted,
but Simon arranged that their names
should not be recorded in the ordinances enacted
by him. R. Nathan subsequently made peace with
the Patriarch, but the breach with Meïr endured.
Simon at length excommunicated him, but Meïr was
not as submissive as he who, without a word, had
accepted Gamaliel's sentence. Referring to a
former resolution of the Synhedrion in Usha, that
no member could be excommunicated, Meïr replied,
"I do not care for your sentence until you prove to
me on whom, on what grounds, and under what conditions
it can be imposed." In proud recognition
of his own worth, Meïr is said on his death-bed to
have uttered the words: "Tell the sons of the
Holy Land that their Messiah has died in a
foreign land." According to his last will, his body
was buried on the sea-shore.</p>

<p>Simon's patriarchate was not free from the disturbances
and oppressions which the Roman officials
permitted themselves to perpetrate towards the
Jewish people. The mutual hatred of Jews and
Romans, which had followed from the revolt of Bar-Cochba
and Hadrian's persecution, was so great
that the powerful victors could not do otherwise
than make their power felt by those whom they had
conquered. Simon ben Gamaliel notes the daily
tortures and oppressions: "Our forefathers only
scented trouble from afar; we, however, have
suffered from them through many days, years,
periods, and cycles; we have more right to become
impatient than our forefathers. If, as formerly, we
desired to record our troubles and temporary relief
on a scroll, we should not find space enough." The
hatred of the Romans on the one hand, and the endurance
of the Jews on the other, appear to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">447</a></span>
ended in a fresh revolution in Judæa, which took
place in the last year of the reign of the Emperor
Antoninus Pius (161), but its rise, scene of action,
and results are not known. The attempt at a new
call to arms appears to have been connected with
the warlike preparations commenced by the Parthians
against Rome. Though often deceived, the
Judæans still hoped for the help of the Parthians, as
a means of deliverance from the Roman yoke.
Simon b. Jochai, who heartily despised the hypocritical
policy of the Romans, said, "When thou
seest a Persian (Parthian) steed tied to an Israelite
tombstone, then canst thou believe in the advent of
the Messiah." Meanwhile, the badly-organized
revolt was soon suppressed by the Governor of
Syria before the Parthians could come to the rescue.
The Parthian war, which lasted several years (161&ndash;165),
began shortly after the death of the Emperor
Antoninus Pius, when the Roman Empire for the
first time was governed by two rulers, the philosophical
but impractical Marcus Aurelius Antoninus
and the dissolute Verus Commodus. At the first
attack the Parthians, under their king Vologeses,
entered Syria, defeated the governor, Atidius Cornelianus,
who had just repressed the Jewish revolt,
put his legions to flight, and devastated the country.
The second emperor, Verus, was sent with fresh
troops to the East, though he was eminently unfitted
to conduct a war. The conquest of the Parthians
was therefore undertaken by capable generals,
whilst the emperor gave himself up to dissipation
in Antioch, Laodicea, and Daphne.</p>

<p>Fresh persecutions appear to have been instituted
by the Emperor Verus against the Jews of
Palestine. First they lost the right of using their
own courts of justice. It is not certain whether
Jewish judicial functions were set aside, or whether
the Jewish judges were deposed. Simon ben Jochai
thanked God for the interference of the Romans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">448</a></span>
as he, like his contemporaries, did not feel himself
fitted to exercise judicial rights. Notwithstanding
that the chiefs of the Synhedrion had taken no part
in the revolution, they yet seem to have been suspected
and watched by the Roman authorities. A
conversation was once reported which took place
between Judah, José and Simon ben Jochai at Usha,
where, it appears, a discussion was held with regard
to the Roman policy. Judah, who, like Joshua,
endeavored to calm those who stood around, had
been praising Rome for her actions. "How useful
this nation has been; everywhere it has erected
towns with market-places; it has put bridges over
rivers, and built bath-houses for the preservation of
health." José kept silent, neither giving praise nor
blame. Simon ben Jochai, on the other hand, could
not repress his displeasure. "What the Romans
do," he said, "they only do for the sake of selfishness
and gain. They keep houses of bad repute
in the cities, misuse the bathing-places, and levy toll
for the bridges." A proselyte, Judah, repeated this,
perhaps without desiring to make mischief. Judah,
however, the eulogist of Rome, was loaded with
honors, José was banished to Laodicea, and Simon
was condemned to death. In consequence of these
events the Synhedrion at Usha seems to have been
dissolved, for the most important members were
withdrawn, and its proceedings watched.</p>

<p>Simon, who had taken refuge, as before stated,
in a cave, became the hero of various miracles. He
is said to have spent years in this cave, supporting
himself on carob-beans and spring water, in consequence
of which his skin became full of boils. When
he learnt that affairs had taken a favorable turn,
probably through the death of the Emperor Verus
(169), he took this as a sign that he might venture
out, and by bathing in the warm springs of Tiberias
his shattered health became restored. Out of
gratitude he declared the town of Tiberias, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">449</a></span>
had hitherto been avoided by the pious, because
buildings had been erected over graves, as clean
and suitable for a dwelling-place. This aroused the
anger of the pious who lived in Magdala (Tarichea),
who considered this decision as a frivolous innovation.
After his return Simon ben Jochai was asked
to repair to Rome, and to intercede with the Emperor
Marcus Aurelius for the abolition of the laws
against the Jews. Simon took as his companion on
this journey Eleazar, the son of José, probably because
he was acquainted with the Latin language.
When they arrived in Rome, assisted by various influential
Roman Jews, they probably succeeded in
obtaining from Marcus Aurelius the concession
sought. Christian teachers also addressed petitions
to the Emperor and requested him to show mercy
on Christendom. The legend relating to Simon attributes
the attainment of the emperor's favor to a
miracle; he had, namely, delivered the daughter of
the emperor, Lucilla, from a demon (Bartholomaion),
and out of gratitude the emperor permitted him and
his followers to take from the state archives whatever
they chose, and they took out the inhuman
decree against the Jews and destroyed it. There
appear to have been actual grounds for this story,
for Eleazar ben Joseph, Simon's friend, boasted that
he had seen in the room the vessels of the Temple,
the frontal of the high priest, and the curtain of the
Holy of Holies, which Titus had carried off as
trophies, and which could be seen only by those
especially favored.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE PATRIARCHATE OF JUDAH I.</span></h2>

of the Mishna&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;The Last Generation of Tanaites&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Condition of

of Judah.</p></blockquote>

<p class="center bpad">175&ndash;219 <span class="smcap smaller">C.&nbsp;E.</span></p>

<p>The last generation of the Tanaites had come back
to the same point from which they first had started,
thus completing the whole circle. In the same way
as the first had found complete expression in a single
personality, Jochanan ben Zaccai, so also the last
culminated in one standard-bearer, who formed the
central point of his times. The former had been
followed by several disciples, each possessing his
peculiar school, tendency, and system; and thus the
material of tradition was divided into a multiplicity
of fractional parts. It was the Patriarch Judah, the
son of Simon II., who reunited them, and thus brought
the activity of the Tanaites to a conclusion. He
was the chief authority of the last generation, compared
with whom the other teachers of the Law
were of no importance; he abandoned the old tendencies
and prepared the way for a new departure.
In spite of the important position which he occupies
in Jewish history but little is known of Judah's life.
It was during a time of great affliction, when the
calamitous consequences of the Bar-Cochba war
were still being felt, that his superior talents and
great parts developed themselves. He so distinguished
himself by mature questions and striking
answers that his father and the college advanced
him to the foremost rank of the disciples while he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">451</a></span>
was still in his first youth. As though he felt that
his vocation was to be the collecting and arranging
of the most dissimilar opinions, Judah did not confine
himself to any one school, but sought the society of
several teachers of the Law. This it was that saved
him from that one-sidedness and narrowness of
mind which is given to upholding, with more fidelity
than love of truth, the words of one teacher against
all other doctrines. The most important of his
teachers were Simon ben Jochai and Eleazar ben
Shamua, whose school was so crowded with students
that six of them were obliged to content themselves
with one seat.</p>

<p>Judah was elevated to the dignity of Patriarch
upon his father's decease, and the cessation of the
persecutions after Verus's death. He was blessed
with such extraordinary gifts of fortune that it used
to be said proverbially, "Judah's cattle-stalls are
worth more than the treasure-chambers of the King
of Persia." Living very simply himself, he made
but small use of this wealth for his personal gratification,
but employed it in the maintenance of the
disciples who during his Patriarchate gathered
around him in numbers from at home and abroad,
and were supported entirely at his cost. At the
time of the awful famine, which, together with the
plague, raged for several years during the reign of
Marcus Aurelius throughout the whole extent of
the Roman empire, the Jewish prince threw open
his storehouses and distributed corn to the needy.
At first he decided that those only should be succored
who were occupied in some way with the
study of the Law, thus excluding from his charity
the rude and uneducated populace. It was only
when his over-conscientious disciple, Jonathan ben
Amram, refused to derive any material benefit from
his knowledge of the Law, exclaiming, "Succor me
not because I am learned in the Law, but as you
would feed a hungry raven," that Judah perceived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">452</a></span>
the mistake of trying to set bounds to his charity,
and he thenceforth distributed his gifts without distinction.
On another occasion Judah also yielded
to his better convictions and overcame his nature,
which seems not to have been entirely free from a
touch of harshness. The daughters of Acher, a man
who had held the Law in contempt, having fallen
into distress, came to Judah for help. At first he
repulsed them uncharitably, remarking that the
orphans of such a father deserved no pity. But
when they reminded him of their father's profound
knowledge of the Law, he immediately altered his
mind.</p>

<p>Distinguished by his wealth and his intimate
knowledge of the subject-matter of the Halachas, he
succeeded without trouble in doing that which his
predecessors had striven in vain to accomplish,
namely, to invest the Patriarchate with autocratic
power, unfettered by the presence of any rival
authority, and to transfer the powers of the Synhedrion
to the person of the Patriarch. The seat of
the principal school and of the Synhedrion during
the time of Judah, and after Usha had lost its importance
(a short time previously it seems to have
been the neighboring town of Shefaram), was first at
Beth-Shearim, northeast of Sepphoris, and later on
at Sepphoris itself. Judah chose this latter town
for his residence, on account of its elevated and
healthy situation, in the hopes of recovering from a
complaint from which he had suffered for several
years. In Sepphoris there seems to have existed a
complete council of seventy members, which was
entrusted with the decision of religious questions
according to the adopted routine. Judah's reputation
was so great, however, that the college itself
transferred to him the sovereign power which up
till then had belonged to the whole body or to individual
members. It was rightly observed of Judah
that since the time of Moses, knowledge of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">453</a></span>
Law and possession of authority had not been
united in any one person as in him. A most important
function which was conferred upon this
Patriarch, or rather which he got conferred on him,
was that of appointing the disciples as judges and
teachers of the Law. He was allowed to exercise
this power without consulting the College, but on
the other hand the nominations of the high Council
were invalid without the Patriarch's confirmation.
The nomination of spiritual guides of the communities,
the appointments to the judicial offices, the
filling up of vacancies in the Synhedrion, in a word,
all Judæa and the communities abroad, fell in this
manner into dependence on the Patriarch. That
which his father and grandfather had striven in vain
to accomplish, came about, so to speak, at his touch.
In his time there was no longer a deputy (Ab-Beth-Din),
nor a public speaker (Chacham). Judah, the
Prince (ha-Nassi), alone was all in all. Even the
Synhedrion itself had resigned its authority, and
continued to exist henceforward only in name; the
Patriarch decided everything. By reason of his great
importance he was called simply Rabbi, as if, when
compared with him, no teacher of the Law were of
any consequence, and he himself were the personification
of the Law.</p>

<p>He soon further increased his powers by deciding
that even the most capable were not competent to
pronounce on any religious question without having
first been expressly authorized by him. How great
was the importance of this act may be seen from the
circumstance that the foreign communities, as well
as those of Judæa, were obliged to put themselves
in direct communication with the Patriarch in order
to obtain their officials, judges, and teachers. The
community of Simonias, which lay to the south of
Sepphoris, begged the Patriarch to send them a
man who should give public lectures, decide questions
of law, superintend the Synagogue, prepare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">454</a></span>
copies of authentic writings, teach their sons, and
generally supply all the wants of the community.
He recommended to them for this purpose his best
pupil, Levi bar Sissi. It may be seen from this example
how great were the requirements demanded
of the instructors of the people. Another disciple
of Judah, Rabba bar Chana by name, a native of
Cafri in Babylon, was obliged to obtain the authorization
of the Patriarch before being able to decide
any questions of religion and law in his native land.
In the same manner a third of his disciples, Abba
Areka, also a native of Babylon, who later on became
a great authority with the Babylonian communities,
obtained this influence solely by Judah's
nomination. One dignity alone, that of the Prince
of the Captivity in Babylon, was on an equal footing
with the Patriarchate, and Judah was all the
more jealous thereof on account of its being conferred
and upheld by the Parthian authorities, while
his office was at most merely tolerated by the
Roman rulers.</p>

<p>Invested with this autocratic power, Judah manifested
unusual severity towards his disciples, and
displayed so great an irritability with them that
he never pardoned the least offense offered, even
in jest, to his dignity. The course of conduct
which he enjoined upon his son from his death-bed,
namely, to treat his scholars with strict severity,
was the one which he himself had pursued all
through the Patriarchate. Among the numerous
Babylonians who crowded to the Academy at
Sepphoris was a distinguished disciple, by name
Chiya (an abbreviation of Achiya), whom his contemporaries
could hardly praise enough for his
natural gifts, his pious conduct, and his untiring
endeavors to spread the teachings of religion
among the people. Judah himself valued him very
highly, and said of him: "From a land far off there
came to me the man of good counsel." But even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">455</a></span>
him the Patriarch could not pardon an insignificant
jest. Judah had once said to him, "If Huna, the
Prince of the Captivity, were to come to Judæa, I
should certainly not carry my self-denial so far as
to abdicate my office to him, but I would honor him
as a descendant in the male line from David."
When Huna died and his body was taken to Judæa,
Chiya observed to the Patriarch, "Huna is coming."
Judah grew pale at the news, and when he
found that Chiya was referring to the corpse of
Huna, he punished the joke by excluding Chiya
from his presence for thirty days. Judah showed
himself equally sensitive in his conduct towards
Simon Bar-Kappara, one of his disciples, who, with
his knowledge of the Law, combined at the same
time poetical talent and a vein of delicate satire;
as far as is known, he was the only Hebrew poet
of that period. The little that remains of the productions
of Bar-Kappara's muse indicates ready
manipulation of the Hebrew tongue in a regenerated
form, and in all its pristine purity and vigor; he
composed fables, of which, however, no trace now
remains. On the occasion of a merry meeting, the
witty Bar-Kappara indulged in a jest at the expense
of a certain Bar-Eleaza, the rich but proud and ignorant
son-in-law of the Patriarch. All the guests had
put questions to Judah, except the simple-minded
Bar-Eleaza. Bar-Kappara incited him to ask one as
well, and in a whisper suggested one to him in the
form of a riddle. This riddle, to which no answer
has been found to the present day, contained in all
likelihood allusions to certain persons closely connected
with Judah. It ran somewhat as <span class="locked">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<span class="i0">She looks from heaven on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ceaseless is her cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whom wingéd beings shun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Youth doth she fright away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And men with old age gray,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And loud shriek they who run.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But whom her net hath lured<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can ne'er of the sin be cured.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">456</a></span></p>
<p>In all simplicity, Bar-Eleaza propounded this
riddle. Judah must have seen, however, by the
satirical smile on Bar-Kappara's lips that it was
intended to banter him, and he therefore exclaimed
angrily to Bar-Kappara: "I refuse to recognize
you as an appointed teacher." It was not till later
on, when Bar-Kappara failed to obtain his appointment
as an independent teacher of the Law, that
he realized to the full the meaning of these words.</p>

<p>One of the most celebrated of the Babylonian
disciples, Samuel by name, by whose medical treatment
Judah had been cured of his long illness,
was unable to obtain the nomination necessary in
order to become a teacher of the Law. Judah was
once desirous of excusing himself for this slight
to Samuel, to whom he owed the restoration of
his health, whereupon the latter answered him pleasantly,
that it was so decreed in the book of Adam,
"that Samuel would be a wise man, but not
appointed Rabbi, and that thy illness should be
cured by me." Chanina bar Chama, another disciple,
who, later on, was also regarded as an
authority, once remarked that a word which occurred
in the Prophets ought to be pronounced otherwise
than Judah read it. Offended thereat, Judah asked
him where he had heard this; to which Chanina
answered, "At the house of Hamnuna, in Babylon."
"Well, then," retorted Judah, "when you go again
to Hamnuna, tell him that I recognize you as a
sage"; which was equivalent to telling Chanina
that Judah would never authorize him to be a
teacher. This irritability of the Patriarch, who was
in all other respects a noble character, was his one
weak point. It is possible, indeed, that this susceptibility
was the result of his ill-health. However
that may be, it did not fail to arouse a certain dissatisfaction
and discontent, which never found public
expression on account of the deep reverence in
which the Patriarch was held.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">457</a></span>
Once at a banquet, when the wine had loosened
men's tongues and made the guests oblivious of
respect, the twin sons of Chiya gave utterance to
this feeling of discontent. These highly talented
youths, by name Judah and Chiskiya, whom the
Patriarch himself had incited to gaiety and loquacity,
expressed it as their opinion "that the Messiah
could not appear until the fall of the two princely
houses of Israel&mdash;the house of the Patriarch in
Judæa, and that of the Prince of the Captivity in
Babylon." The wine had caused them to betray
their most secret thoughts.</p>

<p>In consideration of the altered circumstances of
his time, Judah, by virtue of his independence and
authority, abolished several rites and customs which
seemed to the people to be hallowed by age, and
carried through his design with perseverance,
regardless of all consequences. Contrary to the
principles of his teacher and predecessor, who had
treated the Samaritans as heathens, Judah decreed
that the evidence of a Samaritan in matters concerning
marriage was admissible and of equal
weight with the testimony of an Israelite. The
views of these teachers of the Law of Moses, who
agreed on the chief principles of their religion,
varied in other matters according to the predominance
of friendly or inimical feelings towards the
heathens. For some time past difficulties had been
constantly occurring between the Jews and the
Samaritans. Eleazar, the son of Simon ben Jochai,
and a contemporary of Judah, who had made himself
acquainted with the Samaritan Torah, reproached
them with having altered certain passages of the
holy text. The peaceable relations between Jew
and Cuthæan since the war of Hadrian were gradually
changed to a state of ill-feeling, which was as
bitter on the one side as on the other. One day
when Ishmael b. José was passing through Neapolis
(Shechem) in order to go and pray at Jerusalem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">458</a></span>
(for which purpose the Jews seem to have required
the permission of Marcus Aurelius), the Samaritans
jeered at the tenacity of the Jews, saying that it
was certainly better to pray upon their holy mount
(Gerizim) than upon the heap of ruins at Jerusalem.
Traveling through the land of Samaria must have now
become less dangerous than it had formerly been. The
teachers of the Law had frequently to pass through
the strip of land lying between Judæa and Sepphoris.
Although the seat of the Synhedrion was now in
Galilee, and Sepphoris was thus to a certain extent
the center of the entire Jewish community, nevertheless
Judæa was, for various reasons, regarded as
holier than the northern district. The patriarch
could not officiate in person when the appearance
of the new moon was announced, but had to send
a representative for the purpose (which office Chiya
once filled); the place where the announcement was
made was at this time Ain-tab, probably in the
province of Judæa. This trifling superiority was
still left to that district, the scene of so many holy
ceremonies and ancient memories. The journey to
Ain-tab was made through Samaria.</p>

<p>On another point, also, Judah deviated from the
ancient customs and the Halachic laws: he rendered
less oppressive the laws relating to the year of
release and to the tithes. In spite of the fall of the
Jewish state, and of the numerous catastrophes
which had befallen the Jews, these laws still continued
in unimpaired force, and were doubly oppressive
to a people impoverished by the disturbances
of war, by taxes, and by the extortion of money.
The Patriarch therefore turned his attention to this
matter, and determined, if not entirely to abrogate,
at least to moderate the harshness of these laws.
Furthermore he decreed that the territory of certain
border cities, which had up till then been considered
as forming a part of Judæa, should henceforth not
enjoy the privilege of sanctity which attached to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">459</a></span>
Jewish ground. This in so far constituted a relief,
as these cities were thereby exempted from the
payment of tithes, and doubtless also from the laws
relating to the year of release. For the most part
these border cities were inhabited by Greeks and
Romans, and had not always been subject to Jewish
rule. These alleviations of the burdens of the
people drew down reproaches on the Patriarch
from certain of his relatives, to whom he replied
that his predecessors had left this duty to him.
He had even the intention of entirely abolishing
the laws relative to the year of release, but was
unwilling to take so important a step without first
consulting such persons as were likely to entertain
scruples on this point. At that time Pinchas ben
Jaïr was regarded as the model of austere piety.
He was a son-in-law of Simon ben Jochai, and
possessed so gloomy a disposition as to cause him
to entertain doubts as to the efficacy of any human
institutions. He used to remark that, "since the
destruction of the Temple the members and the freemen
are put to shame, those who conform to the
Law are confused, violence and sycophancy carry
the day, and no one cares for those who are
deserted; we have no hope but in God." In
particular, Pinchas adhered strictly to the prescriptions
of the law relating to the tithes, and for this
reason never accepted any invitation to a meal.
It was with this same Pinchas that Judah took
counsel relative to the abolition of the year of
release. It is probable that a year of scarcity
necessitated the adoption of some such measure.
To the Patriarch's question, "How goes it with the
corn?" Pinchas answered reprovingly, "There will
be a very good crop of endives," meaning that if
necessary it was better to live on herbs rather than
abrogate the Law. In consequence of Pinchas' dislike
of this scheme Judah abandoned his project entirely.
But the Zealot, having noticed some mules in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">460</a></span>
court of the Patriarch's house, to keep which was
not in exact accordance with the Law, refused to
accept Judah's invitation, and left him on the spot,
vowing never to come near him again.</p>

<p>But the most important of Judah's acts, a work
on which reposes his claim to an enduring name,
and whereby he created a concluding epoch, was
the completion of the Mishna (about 189). Since
the completion, two generations before, of the oldest
compilation under the name of Adoyot, the subject-matter
of the Law had accumulated to an enormous
extent. New cases, some drawn from older ones,
others deduced from the Scripture, had helped to
swell the mass. The various schools and systems
had left many points of law in doubt, which now
awaited decision. Judah therefore based his compilation
on Akiba's partially arranged collection
of laws as taught and corrected by Meïr, retaining
the same order. He examined the arguments
for and against every opinion, and established
the Halachic precepts according to certain ordinances
and principles. He endeavored to observe
a certain systematic order in dealing with the various
traditional laws relating to the prayers, to benedictions,
taxes on agricultural produce, the Sabbath, festivals
and fasts, marriage customs, vows and Nazarites,
civil and criminal jurisdiction, the system of sacrifices,
levitical purity, and many other points. His efforts
were not, however, crowned with complete success,
partly on account of the various parts of his subject
being by their nature incapable of connection, and
partly by reason of his desire to retain the order
and divisions already employed. The style of
Judah's Mishna is concise, well rounded, and intelligent,
and is thereby well adapted to impress itself
firmly on the memory. He in no way intended his
Mishna, however, to be regarded as the sole standard,
having in fact only composed it, like his predecessors
and contemporaries, for his own use, in order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">461</a></span>
to possess a text-book for his lectures. But by
reason of his great authority with his disciples and
contemporaries his compilation gradually obtained
exclusive authority, and finally superseded all previous
collections, which for that reason have fallen
into oblivion. It retained the ancient name of
<i xml:lang="he" lang="he">Mishna</i>, but at first with the addition of the words
"di Rabbi Judah." Gradually, however, these words
were dropped, and it began to be considered as the
sole legitimate, recognized and authorized Mishna.
His disciples disseminated it through distant lands,
using it as a text-book for their lectures, and as a religious
and judicial code. This Mishna, however, like
the older compilations, was not committed to writing,
it being at that time regarded as a religious offense
to put on paper the precepts of tradition; it was thus
handed down for many centuries by word of mouth.
The Agadas only were now and then collected and
written down, and even this was severely censured
by various teachers of the Law. It is true that
scarce or remarkable Halachas were sometimes
written upon scrolls by certain teachers, but this was
done so secretly, that they acquired from this circumstance
the name of "Secret Scrolls."</p>

<p>In his old age Judah undertook another revision
of his compilation, and made certain alterations
which brought his Mishna into harmony with his
new views. Various additions were also made after
his death by his son. The language in which the
Mishna is written is Hebrew in a rejuvenated
form, interspersed with many Aramaic, Greek, and
Latin words in general use. Judah evinced a predilection
for the Hebrew tongue, despising Syriac,
which was then indigenous to Galilee, on account of
its characteristic inexactness. Syriac, he asserted,
was superfluous in Judæa, and that either Hebrew or
Greek should be spoken by every one. As a matter
of fact, the Hebrew language was in nowise foreign
to the population of Judæa, especially to such of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">462</a></span>
them as lived in the towns. Even Judah's female domestic
slave and tyrant was so well acquainted with
Hebrew that many a foreign scholar applied to her
for information respecting certain words of which
he was ignorant. The Hebrew language was so
easily and fluently spoken that many legal terms
and delicate distinctions, which were the outcome
of the spirit of the times, found their way into Jewish
circles, and were there provided with proper Hebrew
equivalents.</p>

<p>Thus tradition was at last codified and sanctioned.
During the four centuries since the time of the Maccabees,
when the doctrine of the father, as handed
down to the son, had first begun to acquire an influence
on the development of history, tradition had
remained, so to speak, in suspense. Accepted by
the Pharisees, rejected by the Sadducees, confined
by Shammai's school within narrow boundaries, extended
in its application by the school of Hillel, and
greatly enriched by the followers of the latter, it was
through Judah that tradition first acquired a settled
form, and was able to exercise, by means of its contents
and its mode of exposition, a spiritual influence
during a number of centuries. Concurrently with
the Bible, the Mishna was the principal source of
intellectual activity and research; it sometimes even
succeeded in entirely supplanting the Scripture, and
in asserting its claim to sole authority. It was the
intellectual bond which held together the scattered
members of the Jewish nation. The Mishna&mdash;the
child of the Patriarchate&mdash;by which it had been
brought into the world and endowed with authority,
slew, so to speak, its own parent, for the latter
dignity lost by degrees its importance and influence.</p>

<p>The appearance of the Mishna brought the line
of Tanaites to a conclusion, and put an end to independent
teaching. "Nathan and Judah are the last
of the Tanaites," says a Sibylline chronicle, the
apocryphal book of Adam. The Mishna necessitated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">463</a></span>
henceforth the employment of a new method
of study, which possessed but little similarity with
the Tanaite mode of teaching.</p>

<p>The period of the compilation of the Mishna was
by no means a happy one for the Jews. Marcus
Aurelius, the best and most moral of the Roman
emperors, bore them no good will; he seems even
to have cherished a special aversion to them. When
he came to Judæa, in the summer of 175, after the
death of the rebel Avidius Cassius, he found the
Jews clamorous; they had not come respectfully to
pay him homage, but to ask exemption from the
heavy taxes imposed on them; and he, greatly
vexed at this want of reverence, is reported to have
exclaimed, "At last I have discovered a people who
are more restless than the Marcomani, the Quadi,
or the Sarmati!" In Judah's time, the communities
in Judæa were subjected to a tax, called the "crown
money" (aurum coronarium), which was so oppressive
that the inhabitants of Tiberias took to flight in
order to escape its burden. There is not in existence
a single law of Marcus Aurelius in favor of the
Jews.</p>

<p>But few Jews can have taken part in the short-lived
rebellion of Avidius Cassius (175). With the
sensual and bloodthirsty blockhead, Commodus
(180&ndash;192), the son of the Emperor philosopher, ends
the series of good or tolerable emperors, and there
opens a succession of tyrants who cut one another's
throats. In his reign Judæa was doubtless exposed
to all sorts of extortions and oppression. The
barbarous, savage and dissolute Pescennius Niger,
who after the murder of the two preceding rulers
set up as emperor in company with Severus and
a third candidate (193,) and took up his residence
in Antioch, displayed especial harshness to the
Jews. Once when they prayed him to lighten their
burden of taxes, which had now become intolerable,
he answered them in the following words: "You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">464</a></span>
ask me to relieve your lands of their taxes; would
that I were able to tax the very air that you breathe!"</p>

<p>In the war that ensued between him and Severus,
the latter was victorious, and his opponent's adherents
paid heavily for their mistake. During his
short stay in Palestine (200), after he had wasted,
but not subdued, the country of the Parthians, Adiabene,
and Mesopotamia, Severus promulgated several
laws, which were certainly not favorable to
Palestine. Amongst these laws was one forbidding
heathens, under penalty of severe punishment, to
embrace Judaism, or even Christianity. He permitted
those, however, who were "imbued with the
Jewish superstitions" to hold unpaid municipal
offices and to be invested with the dignities of the
magistracy; but they were obliged to submit to the
claims made on them by reason of their occupation
of these posts, such as providing costly plays and
supporting various other heavy expenses, as long
as no violation of their religion was thereby
occasioned.</p>

<p>The numerous bands of marauders which had
collected together during the war between Severus
and Niger do not seem to have been entirely suppressed
in Judæa, but continued to exist in this
land after the departure of Severus. The Romans,
who regarded these marauders as highwaymen,
dispatched troops to hunt them out of their hiding-places
in the mountains, but were unable to disperse
them entirely. Two famous teachers of the
Law of this period, Eleazar, the son of Simon ben
Jochai (who in his time had been hostile to the
Romans), and Ishmael, the son of José the Prudent,
were induced to aid the Romans, to keep a watch
over the Jewish freebooters, and to deliver them
into the hands of the Roman authorities, who put
them to death. Public opinion, however, was loud
in its blame of these men for thus allowing themselves
to become the tools of the Roman tyrants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">465</a></span>
against their own countrymen. Joshua b. Karcha
(according to certain authorities the son of Akiba)
reproached Eleazar most bitterly for his behavior.
"Oh, thou vinegar!" he exclaimed, "the produce
of wine (unworthy son of a worthy father), how
much longer dost thou intend to deliver up God's
people to the executioner?" When Eleazar attempted
to excuse himself by saying that he only
desired "to clear the vineyard of thorns," Joshua
retorted: "Let the lord of the vineyard root out
the thorns himself." Later on Eleazar repented of
his share in the pursuit of the Jewish freebooters,
and is said to have done penance in the most painful
manner. Although he was an Halachic authority,
to whom at times the Patriarch submitted, the feeling
which he had excited by affording assistance to the
Romans was so bitter that he was afraid that after
his death the last honors would be denied his corpse
by the teachers of the Law. He therefore enjoined
upon his wife not to bury him immediately, but to
allow his body to remain in a room for several days.
When after his death Judah the Patriarch sought his
widow in marriage, she rejected his suit, annoyed
probably at the slight inflicted on her husband, and
answered him: "A vessel intended for holy purposes
must not be put to profane uses."</p>

<p>Ishmael ben José was also visited with the disapprobation
of the people on account of his prosecution
of the Jewish marauders. His excuse that he
had received an order from the Roman authorities,
of which he was unable to relieve himself, was met
by the retort: "Did not thy father flee? Thou also
then wast able to escape."</p>

<p>Judah, the Patriarch, was a witness of all these
sad scenes after having held his office for more than
thirty years. With great equanimity he prepared
to die, awaiting his dissolution with tranquillity. He
summoned his sons and learned comrades before
him, and informed them of his last wishes. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">466</a></span>
conferred the dignity of Patriarch on Gamaliel, his
elder son, and appointed Simon the younger to
the office of Chacham (speaker). To both of them
he recommended his widow, who was doubtless
their stepmother, and commanded them to pay her
all respect after his death, and to make no alterations
in his domestic establishment. He strongly
impressed on the future Patriarch the policy of
treating his disciples with severity, but recommended
a departure from his principle of only allowing two
disciples to be ordained, and suggested that all who
were capable and deserving should be admitted to
ordination. He particularly enjoined on Gamaliel
the obligation of conferring the dignity of teacher,
first and foremost on Chanina bar Chama, to whom
he believed himself indebted. His two servants,
José, of Phaeno, and Simon the Parthian, who
served him with great affection during his lifetime,
were commanded to take charge of his corpse after
his death. He besought the Synhedrion to bury
him without any great pomp, to allow no mourning
ceremonies to be performed for him in the towns,
and to re-open the Assembly of Teachers after the
short interval of thirty days. Many of the inhabitants
of the neighboring towns had gathered in Sepphoris
at the news of the Patriarch's approaching death,
in order to show him their sympathy. As if it were
impossible that he could die, the populace threatened
to put to death whosoever should announce the sad
news to them. The suspense and agitation were,
in fact, so great that some violent explosion of the
grief of the crowd was apprehended. The intelligence
of the Patriarch's death was, however, indirectly
communicated to the people by Bar-Kappara.
With his head veiled and his garments torn, he
spoke the following words: "Angels and mortals
contended for the ark of the covenant; the angels
have conquered, and the ark has vanished." Hereupon
the people uttered a cry of pain and exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">467</a></span>
"He is dead," to which Bar-Kappara made answer,
"Ye have said it." Their lamentations are said to
have been heard at Gabbata, three miles from
Sepphoris. A numerous funeral train accompanied
Judah's corpse from Sepphoris to Beth-Shearim,
and memorial sermons were preached for him in
eighteen different synagogues. Even the descendants
of Aaron paid the last honors to his corpse,
although this was in direct opposition to the Law.
"For this day," it was said, "the consecrated character
of the priests is suspended." Synhedrion
and priests readily subordinated themselves to him
who represented the Law in his own person. After
his death he was called "the Holy" (ha-Kadosh),
though later generations seem to have been unable
to offer any explanation of the title.</p>

<p>History has little more to relate of Judah's successor,
Gamaliel III (about 210 to 225) than that
he faithfully executed his father's commands. Such
of his sayings as have been preserved are well
worthy of consideration, as throwing a strong light
on the state of the times. "It is good to be occupied
in the study of religion, if some secular business is
carried on at the same time; the labor devoted to
both prevents sin from gaining ground. The study
of the Law, when prosecuted without some other
occupation, must ultimately be lost and is productive
of sin. He who attends to the affairs of the community
should do so for the sake of his duty to
God, and without any selfish motives of his own;
then will the merit of his forefathers second his
efforts, and his righteousness will endure to all
eternity. To you, however," he said to his disciples,
"I promise as great a reward as if your efforts had
been directed to practical ends. Act cautiously in
all your relations with the (Roman) powers that be,
for they only flatter you to further their own purposes;
they are your friends when they can derive
any benefit from your friendship, but they never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">468</a></span>
stand by you in trouble. Do God's will in such a
manner that you prefer His will to yours; then
will he make your will His own." The admonition
thus given to his disciples, to exercise caution in
their dealings with the Roman authorities, and not
to allow themselves to be seduced by their promises,
evidently contained an underlying political meaning.
For after the death of the harsh Severus, the
Roman empire acquired, and outwardly retained,
for nearly a quarter of a century, through the
influence of three emperors and their Syrian
mothers, a certain Syrian appearance which was
nearly allied with that of Judæa; servile Rome
adopted Syrian habits, and filled her Pantheon with
Eastern gods. By this means the gulf existing
between Roman and Jew was to a certain extent
narrowed. Julia Domna (Martha), the wife of
Severus, was a native of Emesa in Syria, and her
son Caracalla, who was officially called Antoninus
(211&ndash;217), was in nowise ashamed of his Syrian
descent. It was he who extended the full right of
citizenship to every inhabitant of the Roman Empire,
and although this law was merely intended to
allow the imposition of heavier taxes on the population
of the provinces, it had the good effect of
abolishing the marked distinction between Roman
and non-Roman. Although Caracalla and his
pretended son Elegabalus so disgraced the purple
and humanity itself by their vices, that Roman
history of this period has nothing to relate but
assassinations and unnatural excesses such as allow
of no other explanation than the derangement of the
minds of these two emperors, there was still a
certain method in their madness. They contemplated
the gradual effacement of Roman gods and
Roman customs by the introduction of Syrian
fashions. It does not appear that Caracalla possessed
special tenderness for the Jews. This
much is certain, however, that the condition of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">469</a></span>
Jews under this emperor was at least tolerable, and
that, although they enjoyed no especial favors, they
at any rate had not to complain of excessive oppression.
This intermediate and tolerable position
of the Jews, equally removed from happiness and
persecution, is described by Jannaï, one of Judah's
disciples, in the following words: "We neither
enjoy the happiness of the wicked, nor endure the
misfortunes of the just."</p>

<p>A certain religious law which this same Jannaï
was at this time induced to repeal, proves that the
condition of the Jews of Palestine was not too
enviable during the period in question. They were
obliged to pay their taxes, even during the year of
Release, in natural produce, destined for the use of
the standing army. Up till then they had been
exempted, by virtue of a special favor originally
accorded them by Julius Cæsar, from delivering
these supplies in every seventh year, by reason of
the fact that no harvest was gathered in this year,
it being the one during which the land was commanded
by the Law to be left fallow. In consequence
of this dictatorial measure, and probably
during Caracalla's campaign in Parthia (in 216,
which just happened to be a year of Release),
Jannaï, who was the authority of that period, issued
a proclamation, in which he declared that henceforward
it would be permissible to cultivate the land
during the year of Release. He laid especial stress
on the circumstance that it was only permissible to
transgress the Law relative to the year of Release
on account of the payment of the tax being required
of them, and that its abrogation was in nowise
intended.</p>

<p>The youthful emperor Elegabalus, formerly priest
of the Sun-god in Emesa, whom Mæsa, his crafty
grandmother, had put forward as Caracalla's son,
was entirely devoid of any predilection for the Jews,
although appearances seem to lend color to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">470</a></span>
opposite view. This living epitome of all vices, who
disgraced the Roman world for four years (218&ndash;222),
and who seems to have possessed no other vocation
in history than publicly to degrade his heathen gods
and Roman Cæsarism, and to convince every one of
their worthlessness, seems, in fact, to have done
and attempted many things in his methodical madness
that bear a Jewish complexion. He offered
himself for circumcision, and refused to partake of
pork, only in obedience, however, to the commands
of his Sun-god. He proposed to introduce the
Jewish, Samaritan, and Christian worshipers publicly
into Rome, but to subordinate them to his Sun-god,
Baal.</p>

<p>During the reigns of these two emperors, Caracalla
and Elegabalus, the younger contemporaries
of Judah had ample time to continue his work.
The Mishnaic compilation had not, in fact, included
many laws, partly because they were not possessed
of absolute legal force, and partly because they were
as special cases included in the general formulæ.
These neglected Halachas were collected by Judah's
successors, as a supplement to the Mishna. Among
these collectors may be named Jannaï, whose academy
was at Acbara; Chiya, and his twin-sons,
Judah and Chiskiya, Bar-Kappara, Levi bar Sissi,
Ushaya the elder, surnamed "the father of the
Mishna"; and finally Abba-Areka (Rab); all of
them half-Tanaites. Judah's compilation had, however,
obtained so undisputed an authority that its
votaries considered every word of it to be sacred,
and contended that not a line ought to be added to
it. The new compilation therefore possessed but
a secondary value in comparison with the principal
Mishna, and their mutual relations were of such a
character that the former were referred to as "the
apocryphal Mishnas" (Matnita boraïta, or simply
Boraïta), in the same way as the books not included
in the canonical Bible are called "the Apocrypha"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">471</a></span>
(apocryphal books). The compilations of Chiya
and Ushaya alone acquired an authority nearly
equal to that of the principal Mishna, on account of
their contents.</p>

<p>The distinctive feature of the Mishna, which was
accepted as the recognized code, is the severely
legal and even judicial character which it impressed
on Judaism for all time. Everything comprised in
Judaism&mdash;the commandments and prohibitions, the
precepts contained in the Pentateuch and those deduced
from it&mdash;all are considered by the Mishna as
edicts and decrees of God, which may neither be
criticized nor questioned; they must be carried out
in strict accordance with the letter. It is impossible
not to perceive that the conflicts which had convulsed
Judaism, the violent attacks of Hellenism
under Antiochus Epiphanes, the bitter opposition of
the Sadducees, the allegorical misinterpretation and
the subtleties of the Alexandrian philosophers, and,
finally, the attitude of hostility to the Law assumed
by Pauline Christianity and the Gnostics, had all
assisted to bring out and accentuate the strictly
legal character of the Jewish faith. In direct opposition
to the tendency of the Alexandrian and
Gnostic schools to give especial prominence to the
view that God's love was the characteristic feature
of Judaism, the Mishna, the first positive code of
Judaism, cautions its readers against this opinion,
and orders silence to be imposed on one who desired
to express this view in prayer: "Thy love
extendeth even to the nest of the bird." For this
reason everything in the Mishna is legally ordered,
little being left to personal decision; there it is
settled how much a pauper may demand of public
charity, and even how many children a father ought
to bring into the world in order to fulfil his duty of
helping to populate the earth, "which God did not
create to be desolate." In general the Mishna assumes
that the whole of the Torah, including such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">472</a></span>
of the precepts of the Law as do not appear immediately
in the Pentateuch, is composed of ancient
traditions, received by Moses on Sinai, communicated
by him to Joshua, who handed them down to the
Elders, who in their turn transmitted them to the
Prophets, who finally handed them down to the
members of the great assembly. All such laws as
do not appear in the Pentateuch are designated in
the Mishna by the term, "the saying of those learned
in the Scripture" (<i xml:lang="he" lang="he">Dibre Soferim</i>), although its
component parts are not rigorously divided into
these two categories. It is true that in the Mishna
the remembrance of the dissatisfaction of many
Tanaites is still apparent, especially in the complaint
that the numerous decisions which Joshua
arrived at by means of interpretation, "resemble
mountains hanging by a hair," that is to say, are
far-fetched; but, nevertheless, the Mishna holds up
as an inviolable standard all the Halachic laws which
had been in force up to this time.</p>

<p>There repeatedly occurs in the Mishna the assertion
of the equivalence of all religious commands
and duties. The maxims of Rabbi, its compiler,
might fitly be placed on the first page as an inscription:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Which road should man choose? One which is creditable to the
traveler, and honorable in the eyes of mankind. Be as exact in
thine observance of the minor precepts as of the most important, for
thou knowest not what reward is attached to each command. Balance
the (temporal) loss sustained in consequence of the performance of
a duty with its (spiritual) reward, and the gain of a transgression
with its disadvantages. Bear always three things in mind, so that
thou commit no offense: There is an Eye that sees all, an Ear that
hears all, and a Hand that inscribes all thy deeds in a book."</p></blockquote>

<p>The Mishna is pervaded with these views from
beginning to end. The reward of a conscientious
observance of the precepts of the Law will be the
participation in a future world, which awaits every
Israelite unless he refuse to believe in a resurrection,
or in the revelation of the Torah by God, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">473</a></span>
unless he live (or think) as an Epicurean. But
pious conduct is also rewarded in this world. He
who conscientiously fulfils one religious duty will
be favored by Heaven, his life will be lengthened, and
he will be allowed to enjoy a share of the Holy
Land. At the same time the attempt is made to establish
a reconciliation between the worldly promises
held out by the Bible and the reward of the world
to come, a dogma which first assumed a distinct
form in the period following the Captivity. The
discharge of certain duties secures the enjoyment
of reward on earth and in the world to come; such
are the veneration of parents, charity, timely attendance
at the school, hospitality, the endowment of
(indigent) brides, the accompanying of corpses to
the grave, devout prayer, peace-making, and especially
the pursuit of religious studies (Talmud
Torah). As to future punishment, the Mishna
is unacquainted therewith, as also with a hell. For
crimes and transgressions, mention is made of judicial
punishment during this life only, varying of
course with the seriousness of the offense; thus
there were scourging, and execution by the Synhedrion
in four degrees (by sword, by the rope, by fire,
and by stoning), and finally a premature death at the
hand of God (Kharat). The most heinous and
atrocious sins were expiated by death, and lesser
ones by repentance and the Day of Atonement,
while pardon was obtained for sins of negligence by
sacrifice. Of course, crimes committed against persons
were not expiated until their victims were indemnified,
satisfied, and appeased. Every righteous
and moral deed, as well as every misdeed, possessed
its religious importance; but the religious point of
view was not predominant over, but subordinate to,
the secular.</p>

<p>The Mishna regarded as the greatest virtue the
study of the doctrines of Judaism and the knowledge
of the Law or of the Halachas (Talmud Torah).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">474</a></span>
Occupation in these subjects possessed peculiar
merit or justification (Zechut Torah); it protected
and advanced a person here and hereafter. "He
who is acquainted with the Bible and tradition, and
is careful of his behavior, will not easily fall into sin."
The learning, appropriation, retention, and theoretical
comprehension and advancement of the existing
principles of religion&mdash;that is to say, the conservation
and furtherance of Judaism in the path of orthodoxy&mdash;gave
the direction to the ideas and tendencies
of that period. For this reason, he who is learned
in the Law holds a very high rank, and although he
be a bastard, takes precedence of a high priest who
is ignorant of it. A disciple must honor his teacher
even more than his father, or in case of conflict in
his duty to one or the other, must first fulfil his duty
to the former; for a wise teacher brings man to life
in the world to come. It is incumbent on a father
to teach his son the Torah, or to provide for his instruction
in it. The Mishna does not decide the
question as to whether a father ought to instruct
his daughters in the Torah, but advances two opposite
views on this subject: one advocated by Ben-Azai,
who is in favor of the practice, or at least considers
it permissible; the other, defended by the austere
Eleazar ben Hyrcanus, who condemns it; "to initiate
one's daughters in the Torah is as good as to
initiate them in prostitution." This latter theory,
which finally prevailed, exercised a most pernicious
influence in after-times; for while every community
was careful to provide elementary and advanced
schools for its boys, the girls were systematically
kept in complete ignorance.</p>

<p>But although great weight was laid by the Mishnaic
code on the exact observance of the letter of the
Law, a something higher than this observance of
the Law was recognized as piety; namely, the possession
of a certain elevation of mind, of which
the boundaries were far more widely extended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">475</a></span>
than those of the Law. A conscientious man should
keep his word in questions relating to property, although
he be not bound thereto by the terms of the
written law. He who pays his debt in the year of
release, although not under a legal obligation to do
so; he who pays to the heirs of a proselyte the
debt due to the latter, without being legally compelled
to satisfy their claim; and generally he who
abides by his word&mdash;these are the men in whom the
sages delight. It is true that there are certain prescribed
forms of prayer, but it is lawful, nevertheless,
to pray in any language; the principal thing is to
pray with devotion and earnestness. Men ought to
thank Heaven for bad fortune as well as for good.
The Mishna displays altogether a tendency to emphasize
the spiritual value of religion. The sounding
of the cornet on the New Year, the Festivals,
and the Atonement Day of the year of Jubilee, as
prescribed by the Law, ought not to remain an
outward, material deed, but ought rather to create a
certain frame of mind which raises the soul to God.
As illustrations of this view the following instances
are cited: it was not the fact of Moses lifting up his
hands which gave the Israelites the victory over
Amalek, nor the erection of a brazen serpent in the
wilderness which cured them of the bites of the
scorpions, but the turning of their hearts to God.
But this tendency of the Mishna remains only a
tendency, and received no wide development; more
confidence is placed in an obligatory law than in a
conscience which creates its own standard.</p>

<p>Besides the juridical feature, and perhaps as a
consequence of it, the Mishna possesses another
peculiarity which is more formal than essential; it
is characterized by a desire to devise and group together
all possible sorts of cases, however remote
they may be, in order to apply the most dissimilar
laws to their decision (a species of casuistry). This
peculiarity, which in after-times exerted an influence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">476</a></span>
at once favorable and prejudicial to advancement,
and which was conducive at the same time both to
logical acuteness and to sophistry, seems to have
first made its appearance in the public academies of
Jabne and Usha, and in the numerous other schools.
It was probably the ingenious Meïr and his disciples
who most contributed to its cultivation. As if it
were not sufficient to consider and decide such cases
as really occurred, according to the already existing
laws and principles of the Pentateuch and tradition,
teachers occupied themselves in depicting fantastic
and intricate situations, simply to show, for example,
that it was occasionally possible for several laws to
apply to a single act. The Mishna admitted all
these hypothetical cases constructed by the schools,
and perhaps added to their number. This casuistic
peculiarity was especially employed in order to give
a clear idea of certain cases where cumulative punishments
or atonements were incurred.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that the Mishnaic compilation
contains no Halachas of a character hostile to the
Jewish professors of Christianity; it does not touch
on this subject in any place, not even declaring
whether it is allowed or prohibited to eat meat
cooked by the Minæans. It appears that the danger
with which Judaism had been threatened by the
Jewish Christians, since the destruction of the Temple
until the Bar-Cochba war, had already been
averted, and that danger was now no longer to be
dreaded. On the other hand, and in order to avoid
the least appearance of participation in idolatry, the
Mishna contains numerous laws directed against
heathenism and intercourse with the heathens. The
teachers of Christianity immediately experienced the
want of some such protective laws for the preservation
of the Christian communities, and Tertullian,
one of the Fathers of the Church (a younger contemporary
of Judah the Patriarch, and the first
Christian author who wrote in Latin), expressed a
desire that the Christians should be kept apart from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">477</a></span>
the heathens just as strictly as the Jews were by the
prescriptions of the Mishna; the reason for this was
that heathenism had continued to make its way into
Palestine since the Bar-Cochba war, and had gained
possession not only of coast towns, but even of inland
places. It was necessary, therefore, to regulate
the conduct of the people accordingly. The Mishna
devotes a special treatise (Aboda Zara) to this subject;
it prohibits the intercourse with heathens for
three days before their principal public festivals,
such as the kalends of January, the Saturnalia, the
anniversary of the accession or the death of the
emperor. It also commands the people not to frequent
such of the shops of the heathens as are decorated
with laurel wreaths. The Jews are forbidden
to sell ornaments or other objects for the use of
idols to the heathens, or to let to them any houses
in Palestine, because they would be desecrated by
the introduction of images of idols. On account of
the hatred entertained against them by the heathen
inhabitants of Palestine, the Jews are further commanded
not to allow themselves to be attended
during any illness by the heathens, or even to allow
their beards to be shaved by the latter; and in
particular are ordered not to remain alone with them
in any lonely spot, lest they should be secretly
murdered by them. The Roman heathens having
introduced the barbarous custom of setting men to
fight with wild beasts, the Mishna interdicts the sale
to them by the Jews of bears, lions, and all other
animals by which any injury can be caused, and
further prohibits the Jews from building their
basilica, places of execution, or stadia, because they
serve to promote the shedding of innocent blood.
In order not to pander to the unnatural vices
(sodomy) of the heathens, the Jews are commanded
not to commit any animals to their charge; the
Mishna even forbids the Jewish midwives or nurses
to offer their services to the heathen women, because
they would thereby help to bring into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">478</a></span>
world a new child of idolatry. All enjoyment derived
from objects of reverence to the idolaters is
interdicted, and the Jews are not even allowed to
sit in the shade of an image of an idol, and are
particularly forbidden to drink of the wine of which
a portion has been, or may have been, offered by a
heathen to his gods. Most of the laws relative to
the separation of the Jews from the heathen world,
introduced with great zeal and precipitancy shortly
before the destruction of the Temple, are retained
and extended by the Mishna. Notwithstanding all
its hatred of the heathens generally, and especially
those in Palestine (the Mishna paid but little attention
to foreign countries), the Jewish legislation was
unable to entirely belie the distinctive trait of
Judaism, its universal love of mankind. Together
with these hostile laws, there was also adopted one
which was favorable to the heathens, due probably
to the initiative of Rabban Gamaliel I: their poor
were given access to the fields, and possessed,
equally with the Jews, the right of gleaning. A
special treatise, called "The Sayings of the Fathers"
(Pirke Aboth), is devoted to the teachings of a
higher morality, and contains the maxims and short
sentences of the sopheric teachers and sages from
the earliest times. These laws of morality, however,
are concealed, and, as it were, overgrown by a mass
of law relating to the ritual.</p>

<p>With the completion of the Mishna and the
almost equally important Boraïtas, the Tanaites had
accomplished their task of imparting a settled form
and lasting shape to the hitherto uncertain and
transitory matter of tradition; they had called it to
life, and presented it to the Jewish nation as common
property. After completing their task with
noble assiduity, untiring zeal, and unexampled self-denial,
they disappeared from the scene, leaving to
future generations the result of their efforts, from
which to receive their education and imbibe a love
of their religion and nationality.</p>

<p>After the extinction of the Tanaites and the death
of the younger contemporaries of the compiler of
the Mishna and of his son Gamaliel III, a happier
period commenced: happy abroad by reason of the
favorable political situation brought about by the
friendly attitude assumed towards the Jews by one
of the best of the Roman emperors; happy at
home through the agency of a series of vigorous-minded
men, who imbued the ancient customs and
manners with a new and healthy spirit. The most
prominent men and the lights of this epoch were:
in Judæa, the Patriarch Judah II, son of Gamaliel;
Jochanan, the principal authority of these times;
and Simon b. Lakish, the Teacher, robust of hand
and brain; and in Babylonia, Abba-Areka and
Samuel. These men were the pioneers of a new
movement, connected, it is true, with the labors of
the Tanaites, inasmuch as it was grounded upon
their work, but yet went beyond it in range. A
sketch of the leading personalities of this period
will not perhaps be considered superfluous.</p>

<p>But little is known of the early life and training
of Judah the Patriarch. His youth was passed in
a time when religious strictness had acquired so
predominant an importance, that the family of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">480</a></span>
Patriarch himself was open to censure in case any
of its members acted contrary to prescribed law.
Judah was walking one Sabbath-day, with his brother
Hillel, in Biri, wearing a pair of shoes decorated
with golden buckles, which seems to have been
prohibited in that town. They were sharply censured
by the populace on this account, and, not
daring to explain that the act was not contrary to
the Law, they were obliged to take off their shoes
and give them to their slaves. On another occasion,
when the two sons of the Patriarch were one
day bathing together in Kabul, the people called
out to them "that in their city it was not lawful for
two brothers to bathe together." When Judah succeeded
his father in the office of Patriarch (about
225) he transferred the seat of this dignity from
Sepphoris to Tiberias, and this city, formerly
avoided on account of its uncleanliness, was thus
invested by him with considerable importance; it
outlived all the other cities of Judæa, however rich
in memories, and was the last retreat of the ancient
traditions. The announcement of the appearance
of the new moon, which on account of a certain
preference shown to the south of Judæa had formerly
been made there, was now ordered by Judah
to be made at Tiberias. The south of Palestine,
formerly the principal scene of historical events,
was henceforward bereft of its supremacy, and was
obliged to abandon its rôle to the once-despised
Galilee. Like his grandfather, Judah II was held
in great reverence by his contemporaries, and was
also called simply Rabbi or Rabbenu. He likewise
was often severely censured, but accepted the blame
more patiently than his ancestor.</p>

<p>It was probably the second Judah, as the Jewish
narratives positively assert, that was beloved by a
Roman emperor, from whom he received numerous
marks of favor. Accident, which in the guise of the
Prætorian guards generally gave the casting vote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">481</a></span>
at the election of the emperor, elevated Alexander
Severus (222&ndash;235), an unknown Syrian youth in his
seventeenth year, to the position of ruler of the
world. In public, he gave evidence of a more pronounced
friendliness to Judaism than any of his
predecessors. In his private apartment there was
placed, next to the representations of Orpheus and
Christ, a picture of Abraham. This emperor was
so deeply impressed with the truth of the golden
rule of pure philanthropy, "Do not unto others
what thou wouldst not they should do unto you"
(esteemed as the essence of the whole Jewish
religion before the time of Jesus), that it was always
on his lips, and was placed by him as a motto on
the imperial palace and the public buildings, and
proclaimed by a herald to the soldiers whenever
he desired to reprimand them for attacks on the
property of foreigners. On all occasions he set up
the Jews and Christians as patterns to the depraved
Romans, and was desirous of seeing the highest
dignities of the state awarded upon the same
principles as those which governed the admission
of Jewish and Christian religious leaders to ordination.
He was well disposed towards the Christians,
but seems to have possessed a greater predilection
for the Jews and Judaism. The inhabitants of
Antioch and Alexandria, whose frivolous character
caused them to be better pleased with immoral
emperors than with an austere ruler like Alexander
Severus, derided him in epigrams, and gave
him the nicknames of the "Syrian Head of the
Synagogue" (Archisynagogus, that is, Rabbi) and
"High Priest." The emperor's mother, Mammæa,
however, had a preference for Christianity, and
was a protectress of Origen, one of the Fathers
of the Church. For these reasons, the Patriarch
Judah possessed during this period an almost royal
authority, and was even able to exercise anew
criminal jurisdiction; not quite openly, it is true,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">482</a></span>
but still with the prior knowledge of the emperor.
The latter seems to have made the acquaintance
of the Jewish Patriarch during his frequent visits
to Antioch on the occasion of his campaign in
Persia (231&ndash;234). Judah probably prevailed upon
him to protect, or rather to revive, the privileges
of the Jews. Among these was the right of
again entering the city of Jerusalem, and of filling
the office of judge, both of which rights had
been denied to them by Hadrian. Jewish fable
relates many things concerning the sincere attachment
of the Emperor Severus (Asverus), son of
Antoninus, or simply Antoninus, to Judaism and
the Jews. But although much of this is doubtless
exaggerated and embellished, the Talmud contains
many narratives concerning the relations existing
between the Patriarch and the Emperor which are
certainly historical. Thus it is related of him that
he presented a golden candlestick to a synagogue
(probably that of Tiberias), and granted the Patriarch
a field in the district of Gaulanitis, most likely
for the support of the disciples.</p>

<p>It is quite in the spirit of this emperor of Syrian
origin, prepossessed as he was in favor of foreign
religions, that he should have requested the Patriarch,
as the story runs, to recommend to him a
learned man to aid him in building an altar on the
model of that in the Jewish Temple, and in the
preparation of incense according to the rules of the
Jewish code, for which purpose Judah is said to
have recommended his intimate friend Romanus.
The thirteen years during which the Roman world
submitted to the rule of a good emperor were a
happy time for the Jewish nation, for the sovereign
conferred many marks of favor upon this people,
lately despised and persecuted. The position of
the Jews was indeed so favorable that the opinion
was commonly expressed that Daniel, who had
cast a prophetic glance on the succession of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">483</a></span>
empires of the world, had predicted this state of
things in the words: "When they (the Jews) succumb,
some small help will still be extended to
them," which were considered to refer to Severus
Antoninus, who manifested a love for the Jews.
This favorable situation contributed towards the
substitution of a more friendly spirit in place of
the variance with and profound dislike of the
Romans which had prevailed for centuries.</p>

<p>The Christians complained at this time that the
Jews were much more favorably disposed towards
the heathens than towards themselves, although possessing
much more in common with themselves than
with the heathens. The barrier erected by the Jews,
in consequence of their hatred of the Romans, was
partly overthrown, and the rigor of the separation
of the two nations was relaxed. The family of
the Patriarch were permitted, on account of their
association with the highest dignitaries of the state,
to dress their hair according to the Roman fashion,
to learn Greek, and to do various other things
which had formerly been prohibited. The life of the
Jews assumed altogether a happier aspect: they
began to decorate their rooms with paintings, and
religious scrupulousness took no exception.</p>

<p>To the influence exercised by these friendly relations
with the rulers must probably also be ascribed
the fact that the Patriarch abolished, or intended to
abolish, many of the stricter rules which had formerly
been carried out with the utmost severity. In the
stormy days of the first rebellion against the
Romans, when the wave of racial hatred ran high
between Jews and Græco-Roman heathens, a Synod,
in order to put a stop to all intercourse with the
heathens, had forbidden the Jews to purchase or
make use of their oil and various other articles of
food. In Palestine, this restraint did not fall heavily
on the Jewish inhabitants, as the land produced all
that was necessary to satisfy the daily wants of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">484</a></span>
people, and the oil exported from Galilee afforded
a sufficient supply to the neighboring countries.
But the war of Hadrian devastated Judæa and deprived
it of all its oil plantations; the daily need of
oil thus gradually compelled this strict prohibition to
be disregarded. But the legal permission was still
wanting, and, although numbers had dispensed with
it, there still remained many who complied strictly
with the law, as yet unabolished. Judah II therefore
used his best endeavors to obtain a majority
favorable to the abrogation of this law, and prided
himself greatly on accomplishing his purpose; it is
probable that he had to sustain a severe conflict in
order to gain his object. When Simlaï, the Patriarch's
assessor, who was constantly traveling between
Galilee and Babylon, brought the news that
permission had been granted to the Jewish inhabitants
of countries bordering on the Euphrates (who
had always been restive under restraints imposed
upon them) to make use of the oil of the heathens,
this innovation appeared so daring to Abba-Areka
(the principal Babylonian authority), that he refused
to believe the report. Samuel, however, who desired
to see the authority of the Patriarch generally recognized
even in Babylon, compelled him to make
use of this permission.</p>

<p>Another alleviation proposed by the Patriarch,
according to which the onerous marriage with a deceased
brother's widow was to be evaded in certain
cases by a bill of divorce, to be given before death,
was not agreed to by his College. He was also
desirous of permitting the use of bread made
by the heathens. Finally, he proposed to abolish
the fast of the month of Ab, instituted in commemoration
of so many catastrophes, according to some
authors in totality, according to others in certain
cases only. The contemporary teachers of the
Law, however, were opposed to these alterations;
but, on the other hand, they agreed with him in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">485</a></span>
abolishing a mark of affliction introduced during the
period of adversity under Hadrian: henceforward it
was allowable for brides to ride in state-litters on
their wedding-day.</p>

<p>In spite of the reverence felt by the teachers of
the Law for the Patriarch Judah, they were not blind
to his weaknesses, and he was obliged to submit to
numerous attacks on their part. The Patriarchate
had acquired in his hands an almost royal power,
and was even entitled to a body-guard, ready to enforce
the commands of the Patriarch. This power,
although not abused by Judah, was all the more
displeasing to the teachers of the Law, since he, on
his side, conferred no particular favors on the
learned classes, but rather exerted himself to abolish
the distinction between the learned and illiterate
in all civil relations. He further subjected the
teachers of the Law to a share of the communal
burdens. Simeon ben-Lakish, one of those outspoken
men who carry their love of truth even to
the length of disrespect of persons, was especially
opposed to this leveling policy, and gave vent to
offensive sallies against the Patriarch. Once, in
the lecture-hall, he put forward the proposition:
That in case the Patriarch should render himself
guilty of a crime, it would be necessary to sentence
him, like any ordinary man, to the punishment of
scourging. Upon this it was observed by Chaggai,
that in such a case he would have to be absolutely
deposed, and debarred from taking office again lest
he should employ his power in revenging himself
upon the authors of his disgrace. This discussion
was manifestly an attack upon Judah's possession
of extraordinary power. Angry at these remarks,
and carried away by his first impulse, he immediately
despatched his Gothic slaves to seize the fault-finder;
but Jochanan, the Principal of the school,
succeeded eventually in appeasing his wrath. Once
the Patriarch complained to Ben-Lakish of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">486</a></span>
rapacity of the Roman authorities, which prevailed
for a lengthened period in all the provinces of the
Roman empire during the reign of anarchy which
followed after the death of Alexander Severus. In
most of the provinces there had arisen emperors,
anti-emperors, and usurpers, who, during the short
span of their reign, assumed the character of ruler
of the world, and conducted themselves in the
countries subject to their sway with true Roman
rapacity. "Pray for me," said Judah to Ben-Lakish,
"for the rule of the Romans is evil." To which the
latter replied: "If thou take nothing, nothing will
be taken from thee." This remark was probably
intended as a rebuke for the covetousness of which
it is impossible to acquit Judah.</p>

<p>The Patriarchs seem to have commenced about
this time to draw a revenue from the communities.
This had become a necessity, as the impoverishment
of Palestine had followed in the wake of its
heavy taxation. A great part of the pasture lands
had fallen into the hands of the heathens dwelling
in the country, to whom the Jewish proprietors had
been obliged to sell. Through this impoverishment
the means of maintaining the school-houses and the
pupils were greatly diminished. The income of
Judah, unlike that of his grandfather, proved insufficient
for the purpose, and he was therefore obliged
to open up new sources of income in order worthily
to support the dignity of Patriarch. He sent messages
abroad to make collections amongst the rich Jews.
One of the most important teachers of the Law in
Lydda, named Joshua ben Levi, made a special
journey to Rome for this purpose. In Rome some
wealthy Jews were known to live. These willingly
contributed to the support of the institution which
replaced the Synhedrion, and which was the last
remnant of an independent state, and the representative
of which was supposed to be descended from
or connected with the royal house of David. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">487</a></span>
related that the Jewish ship-owners and merchants
gave up the tenth part of their gains to the support
of the disciples in the school of Tiberias. This grant
was called the Patriarch's tax, and the mission-tax
(Apostole), also crown money (aurum coronarium).</p>

<p>Meanwhile, however greatly Judah's avarice may
have been blamed, he still stood high in the favor
of the populace, by reason of the simplicity of his
manners and attire, which caused his proud and
almost royal dignity to be forgotten. He was
accustomed to wear linen clothes, and to dispense
with all etiquette in his reception of ceremonious
visits, thereby calling down upon himself the
reproaches of his friends, who expressed their
opinion that a ruler ought to appear in magnificence,
and to maintain an imposing demeanor.</p>

<p>How great a reverence was felt for Judah may
be seen from the fact that, on his death, no less
honors were paid to his body than had been shown
to his grandfather, Judah I. In direct opposition
to the Law, a descendant of Aaron was compelled
to take charge of his corpse; it being alleged that
it was permissible in this instance to lay aside the
holy character of his priesthood.</p>

<p>Hillel II., the brother of the Patriarch, was possessed
of great skill in the Agadic exposition of
the Scriptures, and seems to have been a profoundly
moral man. Among the many maxims said to have
been uttered by him, the following is especially
worthy of note:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Separate not thyself from the rest of the community; put not
overmuch trust in thyself (in thy piety) before thy death; judge not
thy neighbor until thou hast been placed in his position."</p></blockquote>

<p>It was probably owing to Hillel's profound
knowledge of the Scriptures that he was visited by
Origen, the philosophical Father of the Church,
who desired to consult him concerning certain
difficult passages in the Bible. Origen called him
the Patriarch Jullos.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">488</a></span>
The spirit of investigation awakened by the
Fathers of the Church, Pantæus and Clemens of
Alexandria, in the Christian school of Alexandria,
which sought to connect the Old and the New Testament,
revived the necessity of an acquaintance
with the Hebrew language, in order to explain by
the help of the knowledge of the original text, the
glaring contradictions existing in many places
between the views of the Old Testament and the
now inflexible dogmas of Christianity. It was
Origen who felt most the need of this knowledge,
and he was unremitting in his efforts to acquire
the Hebrew tongue, and in his recommendations
to others to study it. He regarded the Jews as his
masters in the knowledge of Hebrew and the
correct exegesis of the Scripture: he admitted
having learnt from Jews the exact sense of various
difficult passages in the Bible, during his long but
intermittent residence in Judæa (from about 229 to
253). Being desirous of writing a Commentary on
the Psalms, he took the trouble to have them
explained to him by a Jew, according to the traditions.
At that time the study of the Halachas had
not yet superseded that of Biblical exegesis.</p>

<p>Besides Hillel and Simlaï there were other Jewish
teachers well acquainted with the original text, who
confuted the Christian teachers, and laughed at
them for the absurdly childish arguments which
they drew from their corrupt Greek translation,
the Septuagint. They were especially diverted at
the credulity of the Christians, by whom every
apocryphal book was invested with the garb of
antiquity. Such books as the histories of Tobias,
of Judith, and of Susannah were admitted into the
collection of the Holy writings, upon which loose
foundation was erected the fragile fabric of their
religion.</p>

<p>In order to protect the creed of the Church from
this ridicule, Origen undertook the gigantic task<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">489</a></span>
of revising the Septuagint version, mutilated and
crowded as it was with errors of all kinds. His
immediate object was to afford the Christian teachers
an insight into the differences existing between the
translation and the original text, and so better to
enable them to conduct their discussions with the
Jews. To this end, he compared the translations
of Akylas, Symmachos, Theodotion, and three
others which had appeared in the meantime; and
in order to allow of a convenient survey, he placed
them in columns, the Hebrew text, with its pronunciation
in Greek letters, figuring at the head.
These parallel texts were known by the name of
the Hexapla (sixfold). It was labor lost, however,
to compare the wretched and intentionally corrupt
Greek translation with the original Hebrew text.
The Septuagint continued to exist in its mutilated
form, and was even worse confounded by reason of
Origen's industry, for many passages belonging to
other translations were often accidentally introduced
into its text.</p>

<p>The activity of the Palestinean teachers was
directed to another object; their cares were bestowed
neither on the study of the Bible nor on
the establishing of the doctrines of faith; both
these subjects lay outside their sphere of activity.
Their chief energies were devoted to the study of
the oral law in its definite form, the Mishna. This
work had been composed in a brief and laconic
style, and, besides, it contained many passages
which were incomprehensible, the words or subject-matter
having passed out of everyday use. For
these reasons the comprehension of the Mishna
required peculiar study and erudition. The principals
of the schools applied themselves, in the
first place, to the elucidation of the terse and frequently
obscure text of the Mishna. From this
aspect of their labors they received the name
of Amoraim (Amoraï, Expounder). But far from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">490</a></span>
being satisfied with this arid work, or with remaining
contentedly in this dependence, they gradually
emancipated themselves, made new departures, and
believing in good faith that they were standing on
the ground of the Mishna, went far beyond its
boundaries. As the Tanaites had treated the text
of the Bible, so also did the Amoraim treat that of
the second code; they dissected it, and resolved it
into its constituent parts, so that under their hand it
was dissipated, becoming new matter and acquiring
a new form.</p>

<p>The first generation of the Amoraim, following
immediately upon the Tanaites and semi-Tanaites,
constitutes in many points a parallel with the second
generation of the Tanaites. Like the latter it consisted
of a series of talented teachers, who attained
a great age, and whose labors were continued
during half a century. Like the latter, again, it
possessed different schools and systems, and was
divided into various opinions concerning the explanation
of the Law. But it does not afford the
spectacle of violent controversies; for it already
possessed a common and recognized formula, a
settled standard, to which all authorities subordinated
themselves. The oldest of the Amoraim was
Chanina b. Chama, of Sepphoris (from about 180 to
260). He was descended from an ancient and noble
family, and followed the profession of physician;
the science of medicine, inborn in the Levites,
being generally cultivated by teachers of the Law.
The method of teaching adopted by him was very
simple. He was an Amora in the fullest sense of
the primitive meaning of the term; he expounded
the Mishna or the Boraitas with the help of such
comments only as had been handed down to him
by tradition, without allowing himself to make any
independent deductions. If new cases occurred
which were not indicated in the Mishna, he did not
decide them according to his own lights, but took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">491</a></span>
counsel with learned colleagues, or even with disciples,
however obvious the decision may have been.
Chanina occupied the same position among the
Amoraim as Eleazar b. Hyrcanus among the Tanaites;
he was entirely receptive, never creative.
This point of view, however, according to which
the Mishna was regarded as dead stock, was not
acceptable to the younger and more zealous men;
Chanina was therefore deserted, even by his own
disciples, who proceeded to found new academies.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this, Chanina was regarded with
great veneration both by Jews and Romans, on
account of his piety. Once, when he went, with
Joshua b. Levi, a younger contemporary, to visit
the Proconsul (Anthypatos), in Cæsarea, the latter
rose respectfully at their approach, replying to his
friends, who expressed astonishment at his behavior,
that "they appeared to him like angels." He
reproved more boldly and fearlessly than any other
teacher, the deeply-rooted faults of his community,
and tried to rid it of that erroneous belief which
willingly accepts the most incredible miracles, in
order to be relieved of all responsibility. Chanina's
unsparing utterances concerning the people of
Sepphoris present at the same time a faithful
picture of the customs of the period. On one
occasion Sepphoris and the surrounding districts
had been so devastated by the plague that many of
the inhabitants of all parts of the town had been
carried off by it; the only quarter not visited by it
was that in which Chanina resided. The men of
Sepphoris wished to make him responsible for this
plague, on the ground that he had not performed
any miracle to avert it; whereupon he replied: "In
the time of Moses there was only one Zimri (who
debauched a heathen woman), and yet twenty-four
thousand fell by the plague; ye, however, possess
many Zimris, and complain notwithstanding."
Another time, Judæa was visited by a continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">492</a></span>
drought and lack of rain. Chanina had arranged
the prescribed fasts and offered up public prayers,
yet the much desired rains did not set in; whereupon
the people complained anew, and referred
to Joshua b. Levi, the envoy to Rome, whose
prayers for rain for the south of Judæa had been
crowned with success. On the next opportunity
Chanina sent for Joshua from the south, and
united with him in prayer, but again without success.
Seizing upon this occasion, he reprimanded his
fellow-countrymen for their superstitious belief in
the power of a human being to work miracles;
"Thus do ye see," exclaimed he, "that it is neither
Joshua who causes rain, nor Chanina who hinders
it; the inhabitants of Lydda are kind-hearted and
humble, therefore heaven sends them rain; ye,
however, are hard-hearted and callous, and therefore
heaven withholds rain from you." Chanina retained
his modesty and self-denial all through his life, and
justly recognizing the merits of others, rejoiced in
his later years over the fame of those who had
surpassed him. He attained an extreme old age,
and saw three Patriarchs&mdash;the elder Judah, his
teacher; Gamaliel, Judah's son, and Judah II.</p>

<p>In opposition to the conservative Chanina stands
Jochanan bar Napacha (born 199, died 279). Deprived
of both father and mother, who died in his
early youth, he used to say in later life, that he
ought to be thankful for this misfortune, as he
would not have been able to fulfil the strict duties
of filial love in the manner required by the Law.
He was so handsome of figure that the Talmudical
source, usually so sober, involuntarily becomes
poetical in trying to describe his beauty: "Let him
who desires to form an idea of Jochanan's beauty
take a newly-wrought silver goblet, fill it with
ruddy garnets, crown its brim with a wreath of red
roses, and place it between light and shadow; its
peculiar reflection of light will then represent the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">493</a></span>
glory of Jochanan's dazzling beauty." This beauty,
however, partook more of a feminine character, for
he possessed no beard, the expression of manly
dignity. His eyebrows were also so long as to
overshadow his eyes. When he was grown up he
attended the school of the elder Judah, but admitted
that he had understood but little of the profound
Halachic discussion, by reason of his youth. As
he was not rich, possessing only a small plot of
land, he applied himself to business, in conjunction
with Ilpha, a fellow-disciple, when a warning
was given to him to devote his whole energies to
the study of the Law, in which it was asserted that
he would acquire great distinction. For this reason
he abandoned his trade, and again followed the
lectures of celebrated teachers of the Law. He
sold his little plot of ground in order to obtain the
wherewithal to study, exhibiting no concern with
regard to any provision for his old age. It seems,
however, that later on he was maintained at the
expense of the Patriarch, Judah. Jochanan frequented
the company of the teachers of various
schools, in order to acquire a diversified knowledge
of the subject-matter of the Law. He became the
principal assistant of the Patriarch, Judah II, and
was the most productive Amora of his time.
Through the influence of a large body of disciples,
his sayings form a considerable element of the
Talmud. His method of teaching was to search
deeply into the meaning of the Mishna, to subject
every paragraph to severe analysis, and to compare
each maxim with the others; he arrived by
these means at the inference that the Mishna was
not possessed throughout of legal force. He also
laid down certain rules concerning the manner of
arriving at a definite decision in those cases where
two or more Tanaites were of different opinions.</p>

<p>Through his influence Tiberias, with its mild air,
its fertility and its curative waters, became the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">494</a></span>
meeting-place of a numerous body of disciples, who
flocked to him from far and wide. His academy
was even attended by mature and finished scholars
from Babylon, although the newly-founded schools
of that country possessed excellent masters. Over
a hundred Amoraim are known who accepted Jochanan's
decisions as of full legal force, and who taught
them in their schools.</p>

<p>An intimate friend of the Patriarch, he supported
him in his endeavors to modify certain ancient
usages. Jochanan was himself not very particular
on this head, and by far less strict than the Babylonian
school, which came into existence during his
lifetime. In opposition to the existing custom, he
permitted the acquirement of Greek: by men,
because they were thereby enabled to protect
themselves against traitors, and by women, because
the Greek language was an ornament to the sex.
He entertained great esteem for Greek civilization
in general, and ranked it on an equality with
Judaism. He expressed himself beautifully on this
subject: "For that Shem and Japhet, the two sons
of Noah, did cover their father's nakedness with a
mantle, Shem (symbol of Judaism) hath obtained
a shawl with fringes (Talith), Japhet (the type
of Greek civilization) the philosopher's mantle
(Pallium)." It was Jochanan who permitted the
innovation of decorating rooms with paintings. He
was never able to reconcile himself to the Roman
rule, and was unsparing in his denunciation of the
insolent arrogance and heartless violence of the
authorities. He regarded as symbolical of the
Roman Empire, the fourth beast in Daniel's vision
of the four empires of the world, which was a perennial
mine of discovery for the Biblical exegete,
and was even more diligently explored by the
Christians than by the Jews. The small horn which
grew out of the fourth beast represents, according
to his explanation, wicked Rome, which annihilated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">495</a></span>
all previous empires; the eyes resembling human
eyes, which were visible in this horn, indicate
Rome's envious glances at the wealth of others.
If any one is rich, the Romans immediately elevate
him to the office of president of the council charged
with the supply of provisions, or make him a
member of the municipal senate, in order that his
fortune may be answerable for everything. Another
striking maxim of this sort uttered by Jochanan
was the following: "If thou art proposed as a
member of the senate, choose rather as thy dwelling
the desert of the Jordan." He permitted people,
in exceptional instances, to emigrate from Judæa,
in order to escape from the heavy burden of the
municipal offices.</p>

<p>Jochanan's character was marked by a profound
morality; the slave who waited upon him was
allowed to partake of all the dishes prepared for his
master. He had the misfortune to lose his ten
sons; the unfortunate father carried about with him
a small bone of his last son, in order to console all
such as had to bewail a similar disaster, by the relation
of his extraordinary misfortune. "Behold all
that now remains of the last of my ten sons," he was
wont to explain to them. A daughter alone was
left to Jochanan; thus, an orphan from his birth, he
died almost childless. He is said to have had
periods of insanity in his extreme old age, occasioned
by grief at the death of his friend and brother-in-law,
Ben-Lakish, of which he believed himself to be the
cause.</p>

<p>Simeon Ben-Lakish, Jochanan's contemporary
friend, brother-in-law and opponent, was in many
ways his counterpart, and was altogether a peculiar
personage, in whom were united the most opposite
qualities; rough physical strength was coupled with
tenderness of sentiment and acuteness of mind.
Resh-Lakish, for such was his abbreviated name,
seems to have been born at Bostra, the capital of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">496</a></span>
Saracens, about the year 200, and to have died in
275. As Jochanan's constant comrade, he had seen
the Patriarch Judah I. in his youth, and had been
brought up in the school of his successors. The
sources of the Talmud are never tired of dilating
on his gigantic strength and enormous size. He
once engaged himself at the Circus in the capacity
of slaughterer of wild beasts, his duty being to protect
the spectators of these highly popular combats
from the fury of the animals. Ben-Lakish probably
only chose this low and dangerous occupation out
of necessity. Tradition is at some pains to reconcile
and to transform into a beautiful picture the glaring
contrasts existing in Resh-Lakish, his rude strength
and his study of the Law. But his scrupulous integrity
is even more renowned than his enormous
physical strength. It is related that he used to
avoid the company of persons of whose honesty he
was not fully convinced, for which reason unlimited
credit was usually accorded to all whom Ben-Lakish
honored with his society, without any further inquiry.
His earnest and gloomy countenance was never
brightened by a smile, for he considered cheerfulness
to be frivolous, so long as the holy people were
subject to the power of the heathens. We have
already noticed his love of truth and his candor,
which he carried almost to insult in his animadversions
on the abuses of the Patriarch. In Biblical
exegesis he adopted the method of finding ingenious
explanations, in which study he surpassed his older
comrade and brother-in-law. "When he considered
Halachic questions," says a source of the
Talmud, "it was as though he were grinding the
mountains against one another." Ben-Lakish possessed
a certain originality in the study of the Agada,
and advanced peculiar views, which were only estimated
at their proper worth in later times. It was
often questioned in the schools at what period the
sufferings of Job had occurred, the other circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">497</a></span>
of this remarkable drama were also debated,
and the most contrary views found expression.
Resh-Lakish seems to have come to an accurate conclusion
in advancing the opinion that Job had existed
at no period, that he had never lived, and was
simply an ingenious moral creation (Mashal). This
view appeared very strange to his contemporaries,
who were unable to comprehend such a conception.
The names of the angels were regarded by Ben-Lakish
as not having been originally Jewish, but as
being a foreign element transplanted into Judaism,
which had, in fact, been brought by the Jewish nation
from Persia. He was wont to contradict the assertions
of those who extolled the past at the expense
of the present, who declared hyperbolically "that a
nail of the ancients was worth more than the whole
body of their descendants"; or, in another form,
"that if the ancients were angels, we, on the contrary,
are only asses"; he used to say that the existing
generation possessed greater merit, for the
reason that although heavily oppressed, they still
pursued the study of the Law. Although a friend
of Jochanan from his youth, and drawn still closer
to him by the ties of family alliance, Ben-Lakish
was nevertheless at variance with him during his
last years.</p>

<p>The name of Joshua ben-Levi, who formed, with
Jochanan and Ben-Lakish, the triumvirate of the
Palestinian Amoraim, is more renowned in the world
of legend than in history, where, indeed, but little is
related of him. The son of Levi ben-Sissi, he conducted
a school at Lydda, in the south of Judæa. It is
true that the inhabitants of Lydda were not in over-good
repute with the Galileans, who pronounced them
proud and superficial. But Joshua's reputation in
no way suffered from this circumstance, and his
authority was greatly respected. To his opinions
on the Halachas was accorded for the most part
the force of law, even in those cases where the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">498</a></span>
two members of the triumvirate entertained different
views. Joshua himself admits, however, that he
forgot many traditions during the period in which
he was occupied with the organization of the communities
of Southern Judæa. The situation of the communities
of this district had, in fact, been so unsettled
ever since the catastrophe in the time of
Hadrian, that Jochanan and Jonathan were obliged
to journey thither in order to restore peace and
order. Joshua also on one occasion visited Rome,
in the capacity of collector of revenues for the
Patriarch. He had there an opportunity of observing
a fact which exhibited in strong relief the contrasts
existing in the capital of the world. He saw
a statue enveloped in drapery, in order to protect
it against heat and cold, while near by sat a beggar
who had hardly a rag to cover his nakedness. He
is said to have expected the Messiah to appear in
the capital of the world, where he supposed that he
existed in the guise of a servant, waiting among the
beggars and cripples at the gate, and expecting
every moment to be called upon to effect the deliverance
of Israel. According to the legend, Joshua
ben-Levi was regarded as one of those choice spirits
who were admitted to the most intimate intercourse
with the prophet Elijah, and over whom death itself
was obliged to relinquish its power. He wrested
the sword from the angel of death, went to Heaven
alive, measured the expanse of the Heavens, of
Paradise, and of Hell, and forwarded the results of
his investigation to Gamaliel through the medium
of the destroying angel himself, who was obliged to
submit to his orders.</p>

<p>An original path in the explanation of the Agada
was struck out by Simlaï; he it was who first considered
this collection worthy of profounder study.
Born at Lydda, he had quitted this desolate region,
and had settled down at Nahardea, where the new
school of the Babylonian Amoraim was first coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">499</a></span>
to its prime. He entertained the most friendly relations
with the Patriarch Judah II. He possessed
but small weight in questions relating to the study
of the Law, and his Halachic attainments were not
esteemed in Palestine. He was the first to collect
together all the commands contained in the Jewish
Law, numbering 613, of which 365 are prohibitions,
and 248 affirmative precepts. David, according to
Simlaï, reduced these 613 commands to the following
eleven virtues: honesty, justice, truthfulness,
abhorrence of calumny, of malice and of injuring one's
neighbor, despising the wicked, reverence of the
worthy, sanctity of oaths, unselfish lending without
interest, and forbearance from bribery. Isaiah
summed them up in six, as follows: to be just in
our conduct, honest in our speech, to despise self-interest,
to keep our hand from bribery, our ear
from wicked insinuations, and our eye from base
desires. The Prophet Micah reduced the commands
of the Law to three leading principles: the exercise
of justice, love of charity, and humility; while the
second Isaiah brought them down to two, which are,
to cherish justice and to exercise charity. Finally,
the Prophet Habakkuk expressed them all in a
single formula: "The just man lives by his faith."
This was the first attempt to reduce the whole Law
of Israel to principles. A beautiful parable, in which
Simlaï indicates the part played by every nation in
the history of the world, affords evidence both of
the wide extent of his views and of his poetical
talent.</p>

<p>Possessed of a profound knowledge of the Scripture,
and gifted with an elevated mind, Simlaï was
especially qualified to enter into discussion with the
Fathers of the Church, and to shake the arguments
which they drew from the Old Testament in support
of the dogmas of Christianity. In these discussions
Simlaï gave evidence of a sound exegesis, free from
misinterpretations. During the time of the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">500</a></span>
generation of Amoraim, Christianity had entered
upon a new stage; in opposition to the tendency of
the primitive Christians (Ebionites and Nazarenes),
a universal Catholic Church had come into existence,
whose fundamental doctrines (dogmas), collected
from all quarters, some Pauline, others anti-Pauline,
others heathen, were generally assented to by the
majority of Christians. The various sects of primitive
Christians and Gnostics were vanquished,
being either embodied in the incorporated Catholic
Church or rejected as heretical. This creation of
a Catholic Church and the unification of the Christian
religion, accomplished in the midst of all this
diversity and schism, were largely brought about
by the Bishops of Rome. These arrogated to themselves,
on the strength of their seat in the capital of
the world, the supremacy over all the other bishops
and patriarchs, expelled them from the community
for unorthodox opinions (as in the case of the discussion
concerning the celebration of the Passover),
and gradually obtained recognition as chief-bishops
and Popes. After the completion of this work the
spirit of research also made its appearance among
the Christians, and the traditions of the Church were
subjected to a thorough investigation.</p>

<p>New dogmas had made their appearance, which
the authorities sought to establish and secure. The
rigid doctrine of the Unity of God, derived by
Christianity from the parent religion, had in course
of time, and in proportion as the new Church glorified
the Messiahship of Jesus, given rise to a doctrine
of duality: Father and Son, or the Creator
of the World, and the Logos. To these was soon
added a third. The primitive Jewish view of the
inspiration by God of the Prophets and other pious
persons, which was, in this signification, characterized
as holy inspiration (Ruach-ha-Kodesh), crystallized in
Christianity into the dogma of the Holy Ghost considered
as a person, and regarded as an equality with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">501</a></span>
God and Christ and as having originally co-existed
with them. Without being aware of the fact, Christianity,
which considered itself a truly spiritual and
refined Judaism, had adopted an entirely different idea
of God, in fact, a sort of tritheism. The more the
Christian dogma of the Trinity was at variance with
the very essence of Judaism, the more trouble was
taken to establish that it was supported by the Old
Testament, in order to give it thus the stamp of
antiquity. This proof, however, was not to be furnished
by straightforward means, and thus the
Fathers of the Church of the Palestinean and Alexandrian
schools, being acquainted with Hebrew,
were obliged to take refuge in all sorts of allegorical
interpretations. Wherever the Scriptures contained
several denominations for God, they professed to
see an indication of the Trinity in the letter of the
text itself. Even the simple opening words of the
Pentateuch, "In the beginning God created heaven
and earth," were interpreted by this Christology in
proof of Christ's co-operation in the creation of the
world; for "the beginning" was interpreted to mean
"wisdom," or the "Word" (Logos), being synonymous
with Christ, and this sentence was thus found
to contain the profound secret that "God created
the world in Christ"! As long as the leading spirits
of Christianity remained ignorant of the Hebrew
sources, they were not in a position to hold any
serious conference on matters of religion. It was
only when the Fathers of the Church applied themselves,
like Origen, to the acquirement of a clearer
Hebrew text, that polemical discussions on Christological
themes became more frequent.</p>

<p>Simlaï, in particular, defended the doctrine of the
unity of God against the Christian dogma of the
Trinity, and adduced the proofs for his contention
with consummate skill. His opponent in this theoretical
dispute was perhaps Origen, who was for a
long time a resident in Palestine. By the help of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">502</a></span>
sober method of interpretation Simlaï established the
fact that all the passages of the Holy Scripture
which appear to afford an argument in support of
the Trinity, in reality bring out and emphasize so
strongly the unity of God, that any misconception
appears impossible. Jew and Christian who, like
quarrelsome brothers, had cherished feelings of
animosity to each other during the time they had
lived under one roof, now contented themselves with
carrying on religious controversies.</p>

<p>The attacks upon Christianity during this period
had the effect of producing a certain acquaintance
with Jewish literature even in the heathens, who
turned it to account in their efforts to restrain the
growth of Christianity. In Daniel, the Christian
dogmatists had discovered a Sibylline book, with
vague insinuations and mystic numbers, which they
contended contained prophecies relating to the
Christian economy and to the appearance of Christ
on the Day of Judgment. In opposition to these
views the heathen philosopher Porphyry wrote a
polemical commentary on the book of Daniel, which
is certainly the only Biblical commentary composed
by a heathen. This neo-Platonist, who was possessed
of moderate but mystic views, bore the oriental
name of Malchus, and was a native of Batanea,
formerly a Jewish province. He asserted in his
commentary that the book of Daniel is the work of
an author who lived during the time of the persecution
of Judaism and the Jews by the Syrian monarch,
Antiochus Epiphanes, and that the ambiguous expressions
in which it abounds are only allusions to
that period, and in nowise prophecies, still less oracular
proofs of the facts of Christianity.</p>

<p class="center bpad">219&ndash;279 <span class="smcap smaller">C.&nbsp;E.</span></p>

<p>During the Patriarchate of Judah II. many important
events occurred in the Jewish community of
Babylonia, which contributed to place that country
in the foreground of Jewish history. After the loss
of their mother, the children of Israel had found a
second in Babylonia, and had never yet experienced
a stepmother's treatment at her hands. Babylonia,
the Italy of the East, whose capital had in ancient
times, like Rome, first been the ruler of the world,
and then the point of attack of uncivilized tribes in
their migrations; whose name still exercises a certain
magic in the distance, even after its fall; Babylonia,
which had already been the temporary abode
of the Jewish race, now became for a long period
the permanent scene of Jewish activity. Judæa, on
the other hand, gradually fell into the background.
The peculiar formation of the country between the
Euphrates and the Tigris facilitated the separation
of Judaism from its primitive scene of action, and
brought about the transplantation of Jewish genius
into a foreign zone; by reason of the abundant opportunities
of employment which the land afforded,
similar to those to which they had been accustomed,
it became a second fatherland for the homeless
nation. The great number of the Jews who had inhabited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">504</a></span>
this district time out of mind; their independence,
which had suffered no restraint at the
hands of the Parthian and Persian rulers; the luster
imparted to their situation by the possession of a
political chief; their inherent, self-contained vitality,
unweakened by suffering and petty annoyances, all
these things contributed to invest their character with
a peculiar quality and to further the evolution of
new parts and tendencies. The sojourn in Babylonia
imbued the Jewish mind with that particular
form of keen intelligence which discovers an answer
to every question, a solution to every riddle, and is
discouraged by no difficulties. The Jews of this
country acquired studious, plodding, energetic
habits; the successive leaders and principals of the
schools showed them the paths of profound wisdom
and impressed on them the seal of elevated thought.</p>

<p>The word Babylonia, as used in Jewish history, is
capable of a broad and a narrow interpretation, and
possesses, in fact, three different meanings. In the
broadest sense in which it occurs it includes the
whole district between the Zagros mountains and
the Euphrates, from the sources of the twin-river
Tigris-Euphrates to the Persian Gulf. In a narrower
sense it signifies the strip of land enclosed between
the two rivers, where their beds begin to converge
towards each other and at last actually unite, and
where numerous canals formerly intersected the
country and connected their streams: the southern
part of Mesopotamia, the ancient province of Babel,
and a portion of the former kingdom of Chaldæa.
Babylonia, as understood in this narrow sense, was
principally inhabited by Jews, and for this reason
was also known by the name of "the land of Israel."
Finally, in its most limited sense, Babylonia designates
a small district on the eastern bank of the
Euphrates, of which the center-point seems to have
been the town of Pumbeditha. This district extends
from Nahardea in the north to Sora in the south, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">505</a></span>
distance of twenty-two parasangs (sixty-eight miles).
The fixing of the boundaries of Jewish Babylonia is
not a matter of indifference for history, as in former
times it constituted a matter of conscience. Even
in Judæa the natives of Babylonia of Jewish origin
were admitted to possess the most unsullied purity
of descent, and to have refrained from all intercourse
with heathens, slaves, or persons born out
of wedlock; Judæa was far behind Babylonia in this
respect. An old proverb says: "In the matter of
descent, the Jewish population of the (Roman)
countries is to that of Judæa, as adulterated dough
is to pure meal, but Judæa itself is only as dough
when compared with Babylonia."</p>

<p>The Jewish province in Babylonia was divided into
several smaller districts, each of which was known
by the name of its capital. Thus there existed the
districts of Nares, Sora, Pumbeditha, Nahardea,
Nahar-Pakod, Machuza, and some others, all of
them possessed of some characteristic, such as a peculiar
dialect, or particular customs or manners, or
even distinct weights and measures. Four of these
towns were distinguished as prominent centers,
each having in turn been at the head of the entire
province. The first place was occupied by Nahardea
(also called Naarda, of which name there
were both a town and a district); this was a fortified
city situated on the Euphrates and a canal called
the Naraga, and was entirely inhabited by Jews; it
lay on the boundary-line of Jewish Babylonia. During
a certain period Nahardea was a Babylonian
Jerusalem; here were situated, in the time of
the continuance of the Temple, the treasure-chambers
of the Babylonian communities for
the reception of the gifts to the Temple, which
it was customary to convey to Jerusalem under
a strong escort. A few miles to the south of
Nahardea lay Firuz-Shabur (afterwards Anbar), a
fortified and thickly-populated town, and the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">506</a></span>
important in the country after Ctesiphon, the
capital.</p>

<p>Near by lay Pumbeditha, situated on one of the
numerous canals of the Euphrates, and adorned
with many palaces. Pumbeditha was none the less
a thoroughly Jewish town, with a Jewish congregation,
and was regarded as the capital of Jewish
Babylonia. Within its territory lay several smaller
towns and fortified castles, which nestled in the
shadow of the capital. The inhabitants of Pumbeditha
were considered acute and cunning, and
were even notorious for their deceit and dishonesty.
"If a man of Pumbeditha accompany thee," said a
proverb, "change thy lodging."</p>

<p>Sixteen geographical miles (twenty-two parasangs)
south of Pumbeditha was situated the town
of Mata-Mechassia. It lay on the shore of a broad
lake, Sora, which was in reality the Euphrates,
widening out over the low-lying country; from its
position on this lake the town also derived the
name of Sora. It was inhabited by a mixed population
of Jews and heathens. The region round
Sora was one of the most fruitful parts of the whole
country; by reason of its low situation it was
inundated every year by the Euphrates and its
tributaries and canals, and the overflow produced
an Egyptian fertility. Pumbeditha was distinguished
for its magnificent buildings and the cunning of
its population, while Mata-Mechassia was noted for
the poverty and honesty of its inhabitants. A
proverb expresses this contrast in the following
words: "It is better to live on the dunghills in
Mechassia than in the palaces of Pumbeditha."</p>

<p>With these three towns of the Euphrates, Nahardea,
Pumbeditha, and Mata-Mechassia, a fourth
contested the supremacy: this was Machuza, situated
on the Tigris, at a distance of hardly twelve
miles from Ctesiphon, the capital of the Parthians.
Machuza, also called Machuza-Malka, from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">507</a></span>
King's Canal (Nahar Malka) which flows in proximity
to the Tigris, was situated on an eminence,
and was fortified with two strong walls and a moat.
Close by stood a castle, called Akra di Coche,
which served as a bulwark to the capital, Ctesiphon.
In spite of the importance which Machuza and its
castle must have possessed for the Parthian and Persian
rulers, it was, nevertheless, entirely inhabited
by Jews, and an Amora expressed his surprise that
the gates of its fortress were not provided with
the prescribed Mezuzas.</p>

<p>The most noted families of Machuza were descended
from proselytes, for which reason their
features differed from those of the remainder of
the Jewish population of Babylonia. They are
described as having been very frivolous, addicted to
pleasure and good cheer, and more devoted to the
affairs of this world than to those of the next;
they were called on this account "candidates for
hell." It is related of the women of Machuza that
they indulged in pleasure and idleness. Once,
when a Palestinean teacher of the Law brought
from Judæa to Nahardea a Halacha allowing
women to wear golden head-bands set with
precious stones on the Sabbath, it was remarked
that only four-and-twenty women in that town
availed themselves of this permission, while in
one quarter alone of Machuza there were eighteen
who appeared with most costly head-bands. The
proximity of Ctesiphon, and its wealth, had probably
some influence on the luxurious propensities and
the manners of the inhabitants of Machuza. This
city also, which was the residence of the king, and
the newly-built town of Ardashir, which lay close
by, were thickly populated with Jews. The entire
district of Babylonia, with its numerous canals,
resembled an island, and its wonderful fertility
made of the whole country one extensive garden.
There was so great a multitude of date plantations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">508</a></span>
that it used to be said proverbially of the Babylonians:
"A basketful of dates for a denar, and yet
they do not apply themselves to the study of the
Law!"</p>

<p>The occupations followed by the Babylonian
Jews were agriculture, trades of all descriptions,
and, what is of course natural in a country dependent
on its canals for irrigation, the digging and
cleaning of these artificial waterways; they also
bred cattle, carried on commerce, undertook voyages,
and cultivated certain of the fine arts.</p>

<p>The greatness of their numbers invested the
Babylonian Jews with a certain amount of independence,
and they seemed in this country almost as
if in a land of their own. Their situation with
regard to the rulers of the land was very favorable,
as they were only called upon to pay a poll-tax
(Charag) and a land-tax (Taska); there was at this
period much vacant ground in the region of the
Euphrates, and any one could take possession of
a plot on becoming answerable for the land-tax
in respect thereof. The Jews possessed their own
political chief, who was called the Prince of the
Captivity (Exilarch, Resh-Galutha); he was a
dignitary of the Persian empire, and the fourth in
rank from the king. His position with regard to
the Persian kings was that of a feudatory. The
Resh-Galuthas were, in fact, vassals of the Persian
crown, but were simply confirmed, not chosen, by
the monarch. Their badges of office were a silken
cloak and a golden girdle; in later times they were
surrounded by a princely luxuriousness, rode in a
state carriage, possessed their own train of attendants,
and an outrider to announce their approach.
When they were received in solemn audience by
the king, the royal attendants showed them the
greatest respect, and they treated with the ruler
on a footing of equality. According to the
usage of Eastern princes, they were entertained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">509</a></span>
with music at the moment of rising from or going
to bed, a custom which was severely censured by
the strict teachers of the Law, on account of the
mourning for Jerusalem.</p>

<p>The Princes of the Captivity were descendants
of the house of David, for which reason the people
gladly acknowledged their sway, since it honored
itself and felt honored in its princes. An old
chronicle gives the full details of their names and
numbers. They traced back their descent as far
as Zerubbabel, the grandson of the Jewish King
Jojachin, who is supposed to have returned to
Babel, and to have become the ancestor of a long
line of descendants. It is not until the second
century that a Resh-Galutha, by name Achiya,
is visible through the deep obscurity of antiquity.
Another, Mar-Huna, in the time of Judah I, commanded
that his body should be brought to Palestine,
in order to be buried in holy ground. From
that time forward, however, the succession of the
Princes of the Captivity can be traced in an unbroken
chain till the eleventh century. They exercised
considerable influence upon the development
of Jewish history in Babylonia. Their relations with
the people are indicated in a few occasional passages
only.</p>

<p>The Resh-Galutha was the supreme judge of the
Jewish communities, both in civil and in criminal
cases; he either administered justice in person, or
delegated his office to judges of his own nomination.
The ordinary coercive measure employed in
cases of disobedience was the bastinado, according
to Eastern custom. The princes were also entrusted
with the police of the cities, the control of weights
and measures, the inspection of canals, and the
guardianship of public safety, to all of which various
charges they appointed their own officers. It is
nowhere indicated what revenues the Princes of
the Captivity derived from the people; it is most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">510</a></span>
probable that the primitive Asiatic custom of making
presents to the sovereign obtained. It is not until
later times that mention is made of regular yearly
revenues drawn by them from certain regions and
cities. They enjoyed an honorable public distinction
which was only conferred upon such rulers as were
descended from David; this consisted of having the
scrolls of the Law brought to them when they had
to read a portion of the Torah aloud, whereas
every one else was obliged to go to the scrolls.
Wealthy by reason of the income accruing from
their extensive lands, they also possessed many
slaves and a numerous suite of attendants; even
free men placed themselves under their patronage,
wearing, as sign of their fealty, the arms of their
masters on their garments. The Princes of the
Captivity were most sensitive with regard to these
distinctive marks, refusing to pardon even the
scholars whom they themselves supported, if they
laid aside or even only covered over these badges.
There was too much power in the hands of the Prince,
and this power was too little restrained or regulated
by law or tradition, for cases of arbitrariness and
abuse of authority not to be forthcoming. Numerous
complaints were made of the arrogance, arbitrary
encroachments, or violent deeds of many of the
Princes of the Captivity or their servants; they
deposed the principals of the schools, appointing
others in their places who were often without merit.
But what power has ever restrained itself within
the bounds of justice and equity? In prehistoric
times, that is to say, before the knowledge of the
Law had been carried to Babylonia and there
domesticated, the ignorance of the Princes of the
Captivity in matters of religious practice appears
to have been so profound, that it was possible to
transgress the laws relating to food in their house
with the greatest impunity. But history tells also
of meritorious persons among their numbers, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">511</a></span>
in later times combined a knowledge of the Jewish
law with the possession of Jewish virtues, and
whose names became a source of glory to the
nation. The Princes of the Captivity often united
with their political power the authority of teachers
of the Law, equaling in this respect the Palestinean
Patriarchs. As certain of these latter attempted
to acquire political influence, in order not to be
inferior to the Resh-Galutha&mdash;in which attempt,
however, they were not always successful&mdash;many of
the Princes of the Captivity endeavored in turn to
obtain the dignity of teacher. All these various
circumstances, the great number of the Jewish
population of Babylonia, their independence, and
the concentrated power of the Princes, stamp the
history of the Jews of this region with a peculiar
character; new needs arose in this country which
were unknown in Judæa; new needs produced new
regulations and Halachas, and thus the Law entered
upon a new development in which, as already
intimated, Babylon played the most important part.</p>

<p>During the patriarchate of Judah I, the young
students of Babylon had crowded in greater numbers
than in former times to the academies of
Galilee, as if desirous of catching the last rays of
the setting sun of religion in the mother-country,
in order to enlighten therewith the land of their
birth. Chiya of Cafri and his two wonderful sons,
his relatives Abba-Areka and Chanina-bar-Chama,
Abba and his son Samuel, were all celebrated disciples
of Judah's school; they were either directly
or indirectly the instructors of Babylonia. It is
true that Chiya and his sons, Judah and Chiskia,
did not return to their native country, but died in
Galilee, where they were honored as saints; but
Chiya exercised the greatest influence on the education
of his disciple and nephew, Abba-Areka.
Before the return to Babylonia of Abba-Areka and
Samuel from the academy of Judah I in Judæa, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">512</a></span>
otherwise unknown person, Shila by name, occupied
the post of principal of the school (Resh-Sidra) in
Nahardea. But with the appearance of these two
men, who were endowed with all the qualities
requisite in order to become the founders of new
schools, extensive alterations were introduced; they
initiated a new departure, and raised Babylonia to
the level of Judæa.</p>

<p>Abba (born about 175, died 247), who is known
in history by the name of Rab, had completed his
education, after the death of his father Aibu, at the
academy of Judah I in Tiberias. Great astonishment
was expressed at the early development of the
wonderful talents of this youth. Through Chiya's
intercession, Rab obtained a somewhat restricted
advancement, which the Patriarch Gamaliel III afterwards
refused to extend. Great things were expected
of him in his home, and when the news of his
return from Palestine was known, Samuel, who had
already returned, and his friend Karna, went to
meet him on the bank of the Euphrates canal. The
latter overwhelmed him with questions, and even
Shila, the principal of the school, bowed to his
superior knowledge. After Shila's death Rab ought
to have succeeded him in his office, but he refused
the post in favor of his younger friend, Samuel,
whose home was in Nahardea.</p>

<p>The Prince of the Captivity of that period seems
to have shown special regard for such Babylonians
as were learned in the Law, in his appointments
to the offices within his gift. He nominated as
supreme judge in Cafri one of his relations, Mar-Ukba,
whose wealth, modesty, character, and knowledge
of the Law well fitted him for this post. He
also appointed Karna as judge, who, not being rich,
was obliged to be indemnified for his loss of time by
the suitors. To Abba-Areka was given the post
of inspector of markets (Agora-nomos), carrying
with it the control of the weights and measures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">513</a></span>
The arbitrariness of the rule of the Exilarch is
well illustrated by the following example. Abba-Areka
had been commanded to control the prices
of the market, and to prevent the necessaries of
life from becoming too dear. Having refused to
obey this order, he was thrown into prison and kept
there until Karna upbraided the Prince of the Captivity
with thus punishing a man who was full of the
"juice of dates" (genius). Abba-Areka had occasion,
by reason of his position as Agoranomos, to
journey to the various districts of Jewish Babylonia,
and he thus became known throughout the country.
Artabanus IV (211&ndash;226), the last Parthian monarch
of the house of Arsaces, who had probably made his
acquaintance on one of his circuits, esteemed him so
highly that he once sent him a present of some
valuable pearls. Between the last Parthian King
and the first Babylonian Amora there existed the
same friendly relations as between the Jewish
Patriarch and the Roman Emperor of his time.
Artabanus was afterwards deposed by Ardashir,
and with him ended the dynasty of Arsaces. When
Rab heard of the fall of Artabanus, he exclaimed
sorrowfully, "The bond is broken."</p>

<p>Abba discovered with surprise during his journeys
the unbounded ignorance of the Jewish laws into
which those communities remote from the capital
had fallen. In one place nothing was known of the
traditional prohibition forbidding meat to be eaten
with milk. In order to repress these transgressions
and to remove this ignorance, Rab extended many
laws, and forbade even what was otherwise allowed.
In this way there arose many restrictions which,
owing to his authority, acquired the force of law.
The negligence existing throughout the district of
Sora gave him the idea of founding an academy in
that very place, in order that the knowledge of the
Law might become more widely spread through the
passage to and fro of the disciples. His efforts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">514</a></span>
were crowned with complete success. If the development
of the Law has greatly contributed to the
preservation of Judaism, this result is for the most
part due to the labors of Abba-Areka. With but
few intermissions, Sora was the seat of Jewish science
for nearly eight centuries.</p>

<p>The academy, which bore, as was customary, the
name of "Sidra," was opened by Abba about the
year 219. Twelve hundred disciples, attracted by
Abba-Areka's reputation, flocked together from
every district of Babylonia. More than a hundred
celebrated disciples and associates afterwards disseminated
his maxims and decisions throughout the
land. The throng of auditors was so great that he
was obliged to enlarge his lecture-room by enclosing
a garden belonging to a recently deceased proselyte,
which he acquired for this purpose as vacant ground.
The reverence entertained for him by his disciples
was so profound that they called him simply "Rab,"
the Teacher, in the same way as the Patriarch Judah
was called Rabbi or Rabbenu, and this is the appellation
by which he is generally known. His school
was called Be-Rab (Be abbreviated from Beth, <i>house</i>),
which afterwards became the general name for
a school. His authority extended beyond the
boundaries of Babylonia; even Jochanan, the most
celebrated of the teachers of Judæa, wrote to him,
"To our teacher in Babylonia," grew angry whenever
any one spoke slightingly of Rab, and admitted
that the latter was the only person to whom he would
have willingly subordinated himself. Rab was accustomed
to maintain such of his numerous disciples
as were without means, for he was very wealthy,
and owned land, which he cultivated himself.
The excellent arrangements which he adopted permitted
his auditors to devote themselves to the
study of the Law without neglecting their livelihood.
In two months of the year (Adar and Ellul), at the
commencement of autumn and spring, they assembled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">515</a></span>
at Sora. During these two months, which
were called "months of assembly" (Yarche Kalla),
lectures were delivered every day from the early
morning on; the auditors hardly allowed themselves
time enough to swallow their breakfast. The ordinary
name for the public lectures was Kalla. Besides
these two months, Rab devoted the week
before the principal festivals to public lectures, in
which not only the disciples, but the whole populace,
were interested. The Prince of the Captivity used
also to arrive in Sora about this time to receive the
homage of the assembled crowd. The throng was
generally so great that many were unable to get
lodgings in the houses, and were consequently
obliged to sleep in the open air, on the shore of
lake Sora. These festival lectures were termed
Rigle. The Kalla-months and the Rigle-week had
also certain influences upon civil life; the judicial
powers suspended their operation during these
periods, and creditors were forbidden to summon
their debtors before the court. Rab thus provided
at one and the same time for the instruction of the
ignorant multitude, and for the further advancement
of the deeper study of the Law by the education of
disciples.</p>

<p>Nothing is known of any peculiar method employed
by Rab. His mode of teaching consisted of
analyzing the Mishna, which he had brought with
him in its latest state of perfection, of explaining the
text and the sense of every Halacha, and of comparing
them with the Boraitas. Of these decisions
and deductions, which are known by the name of
Memra, there exists a great number from Rab's
hand, and they, together with those which proceeded
from Samuel and Jochanan, the contemporary principals
of the schools, form a considerable part of
the Talmud. For the most part he was more inclined
than his fellow Amoraim to render the Law
severer, and to forbid such legal acts as verged on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">516</a></span>
the illegal, at least in the opinion of the multitude
of Babylonian Jews, who were incapable of nice discrimination.
Most of Rab's decrees received the
force of law, with the exception of those, however,
which affected municipal law, for his authority was
more respected in questions of ritual than of civil
law.</p>

<p>With the most determined energy he undertook
the amelioration of the morals of the Babylonians,
which, like their religion, had fallen to a very low
ebb among the lower classes. The ancient simplicity
of married life which had formerly obtained
was now superseded in Babylonia by a hollow and
brutal immorality. If a young man and woman met,
and were desirous of uniting in marriage, they summoned
the first witnesses at hand, and the marriage
was concluded. Fathers gave their daughters in
marriage almost before they arrived at majority, and
the bridegroom either did not see his bride until
after the decisive step had been taken, when, doubtless,
he often repented of his act, or else he lived in
the house of his intended father-in-law in a too intimate
relation with his betrothed. The law, instead
of condemning this immorality, had afforded it the
protection of its authority. Rab combated these
prevailing customs with the full force of a moral
ardor. He forbade the solemnization of marriage
which had not been preceded by a courtship, and enjoined
on fathers not to marry their daughters without
the consent of the latter, and therefore still less
before their majority. He further admonished all
who were desirous of marrying to make the acquaintance
of the maiden of their choice before their
betrothal, lest when disappointed, their conjugal love
should turn to hate, and finally he forbade the
young men to live in the house of their betrothed
before marriage. He baffled all the legal artifices
which could be employed by a husband to make a
divorce retrospective by withdrawing the support<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">517</a></span>
of the law from such cases. All these moral measures
became laws of general application. Rab also
increased the reputation of the courts of justice;
every one was obliged to appear on being summoned
before the court, and the bailiffs were invested with
official authority; the punishment of excommunication
was introduced for cases of refractoriness. This
punishment was very severe in Babylonia, and consequently
produced great effects. The transgressions
of the offender were publicly announced, and
he was avoided until he had made expiation. In
Babylonia, where the Jewish population formed a
little world of its own, this punishment was sufficient
to procure obedience and respect for the laws.
Rab's energies were thus employed in two directions;
he refined the morals, and aroused intellectual
activity in a country which, as the sources
express it, had formerly been "a vacant and unprotected
fallow field." Rab surrounded it with a two-fold
hedge, severity of manners and activity of mind.
He was in this respect for Babylonia what Hillel
had been for Judæa.</p>

<p>Rab's virtues, his patience, conciliatory disposition,
and modesty, also put one in mind of Hillel.
He had a bad wife who opposed him in everything,
but he bore her vexations with patience. In his
youth Rab had acted badly towards Chanina, the
head of the school in Sepphoris, and was therefore
unceasing in his efforts to obtain his pardon. His
forgiving disposition caused him to lose sight of his
exalted station. Once, when he thought he had
given offense to a man of the lower classes, he repaired
to the latter's house on the eve of the Day of
Atonement, in order to become reconciled with him.
Whenever he was followed to his school by a crowd
of people on the days of his lectures he used to
repeat a verse of Job, in order to prevent his pride
from rising too high: "Though the excellency of
man mount up to the heavens, yet he shall perish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">518</a></span>
forever." Before repairing to the court he was
wont to exclaim: "I am prepared to meet my death;
here the affairs of my house concern me not, and I
return empty-handed to my home; may I be as innocent
on my return as I was when I set out." He
had the satisfaction of leaving a son, Chiya, who was
exceedingly learned in the Law, and of marrying
his daughter to a relative of the Prince of the Captivity.
His descendants by this daughter were
worthy and learned princes. His second son, Aibu,
was not intellectually distinguished. To him his
father recommended certain rules of life, among
others a preference for agriculture: "Rather a
small plot of land than a great magazine for goods."</p>

<p>For eight and twenty years, until his old age,
Rab devoted himself to the Sidra at Sora (219&ndash;247).
When he died all his disciples accompanied his body
to its last resting-place, and went into mourning
for him. At the suggestion of one of them
Babylonia mourned for him a whole year, and the
practice of wearing wreaths of flowers and myrtles
at weddings was suspended. All the Jews of
Babylonia, except one, Bar-Kasha of Pumbeditha,
mourned for the loss of their great Amora.</p>

<p>Much more original and versatile than Rab was
his friend, his Halachic opponent, and his fellow-worker
in the task of elevating the Jewish population
of Babylonia, Samuel or Mar-Samuel, also
called Arioch and Yarchinai (born about 180, died
257). In a certain sense this highly talented man
was an epoch-maker in the history of the doctrine
of Judaism. Nothing more is known of his youth
than that he once ran away from his father. As a
young man he followed the usual course, and went
to Judæa in order to complete his education at the
academy of the Patriarch Judah I. It has already
been narrated how he there cured a disease of the
eyes from which the ailing Patriarch suffered, and
how he was nevertheless refused his nomination as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">519</a></span>
a teacher by the latter; how he returned to his
home before Rab, and was elevated after Shila's
death to the dignity of Resh-Sidra.</p>

<p>Mar-Samuel was of an even character, avoiding enthusiasm
and demonstrativeness. While his contemporaries
confidently expected the renewal of
miracles as of old before the appearance of the
Messiah, he propounded the view that everything
would still follow its natural course, but that the
subjection of Israel to foreign rulers would come to
an end. His intellectual energies were employed
in three branches of knowledge: the explanation of
the Law, astronomy, and medicine.</p>

<p>As an Amora he was inferior to Rab in the
knowledge of the laws of the ritual, but far surpassed
him in his acquaintance with the Jewish
civil law. Samuel developed and enriched the
Jewish law in all its branches, and all his decisions
have obtained Halachic force. None of his decrees,
however, were possessed of such important results
as the one by which he declared the law of the land
to be just as binding on the Jews as their own law
(dina d'malchuta dina). The object of this precept
was not to bring about a compulsory toleration of
the foreign legislation, but to obtain its complete
recognition as a binding law, to transgress which
would also be punishable from the religious point
of view. This was an innovation which, after all,
could only be approved by reason of the relations
existing between the Babylonian Jews and the
Persian states. Samuel's principle of the sanctity
of the law of the land was a manifest contradiction
of older Halachas, which treated foreign laws as
arbitrary, and did not consider their transgression
to be punishable. But the Amoraim had already
succeeded in reconciling so many conflicting laws
that these old and repellent decisions, and this new
and submissive principle, were able to exist side by
side. In the sequel Samuel's recognition of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">520</a></span>
laws of the country was a means of preservation to
the dispersed nation. On the one hand it reconciled
the Jews to living in that country into which they had
been cast by remorseless fate. Their religious
consciousness did not feel at variance with the laws
set up for their observance, which were seldom
humane. On the other hand, the enemies of the
Jews, who in all centuries took as their pretext the
apparently hostile spirit of Judaism, and advised
the persecution and complete extermination of the
Jewish nation, could be referred to a Jewish law,
which, with three words, invalidated their contention.
The Prophet Jeremiah had given to the families
which were exiled to Babylon, the following urgent
exhortation as to their conduct in a foreign land:
"Seek the peace of the city whither ye have been
carried away captives." Samuel had transformed
this exhortation into a religious precept: "The law
of the state is binding law." To Jeremiah and
Mar-Samuel Judaism owes the possibility of existence
in a foreign country.</p>

<p>Samuel possessed altogether a particular affection
for Persian customs, and was consequently in
exceedingly good repute at the Persian court, and
lived on confidential terms with Shabur I. His
contemporaries called him therefore, although it is
not known whether as a mark of honor or of
censure, "The king Shabur," and also "Arioch," the
Arian (partizan of the neo-Persians). His attachment
to the Persian dynasty was so great that it
supplanted the affection for his fellow-countrymen
in his heart. When Shabur extended his conquests
to Asia Minor, 12,000 Jews lost their lives on the
occasion of the assault of Mazaca-Cæsarea, the
Cappadocian capital. Samuel refused to go into
mourning for the victims, giving as his reason that
they had fought against Shabur. He thus formed
a peculiar type; living in the midst of the full tide
of Judaism, immersed in its doctrines and traditions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">521</a></span>
he raised himself beyond the narrow sphere of his
nationality, and was ever ready to extend his sympathies
to other peoples and to take note of their
intellectual efforts. Rab, entirely taken up with
the affairs of his own nation, refused to allow the
customs of the Persians to exert any influence on
those of the Jews, and even forbade these latter to
adopt any practice, however innocent, from the
Magi: "He who learns a single thing of the Magi
merits death." Samuel, on the other hand, learnt
many things of the Persian sages. With his friend
Ablaat, he used to study astronomy, that noble
science which brings mortal man into closer proximity
with the Deity. The low-lying plain between
the Euphrates and the Tigris, whose wide-extended
horizon is unbounded by any hill, was the cradle
of astronomy, which, however, soon degenerated in
this region into the pseudo-science of astrology.
By reason of the ideas instilled into him by his
Jewish education, Samuel attached no importance
to the art of casting nativities, and only occupied
himself with astronomy under its most elevated
aspect. He used to boast that he was "as well
acquainted with the ways of the heavens as with
the streets of Nahardea." He was unable, however,
to calculate the erratic movements of the
comets. It is impossible to determine the extent
of his astronomical acquirements, or to discover
whether he was in advance of his times or simply
on a par with his contemporaries. Mar-Samuel
turned his knowledge of astronomy to practical
account; he drew up a settled calendar of the
festivals, for the purpose of delivering the Babylonian
communities from continual uncertainty with
regard to the exact days on which the festivals
would fall, and in order to relieve them of their
dependence on Palestine for the determination of
the time of the appearance of the new moon.
Probably out of regard for the Patriarch, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">522</a></span>
order not to destroy the unity of Judaism, Samuel
refrained from communicating his calendar to the
general public, and allowed the computation of the
festivals to retain its former character of a secret
art (Sod ha-Ibbur). He was blamed by certain
persons, however, for having in any way interfered
with the calculation of the calendar. The extent
of Samuel's knowledge of medicine is even less
known; he boasted of being able to cure all diseases
but three. An eye-salve of his invention was in
great request.</p>

<p>Between Samuel and the founder of the Sora
academy there subsisted a fraternal harmony,
although the Sidra of Nahardea was eclipsed by Rab.
In his modesty he willingly subordinated himself to
Rab. The celebrated Shila family was possessed
of the precedence in the ceremony of paying
homage to the Prince of the Captivity; by them it
was relinquished to Samuel, and he, in his turn,
surrendered it to his comrade in Sora, contenting
himself with the third place. After Rab's death
Samuel was recognized as the sole religious chief
of Babylon, and continued in this capacity for ten
years. At first Jochanan, of Judæa, hesitated
whether to acknowledge him as an authority. In
the letter which the principal of the schools of
Tiberias sent to Babylonia, he addressed Rab by
the title of "our teacher in Babylonia," while Mar-Samuel
he called simply "our comrade." The
teachers of Judæa did not, in fact, give him credit
for the requisite knowledge of the Halachas, basing
their conclusion upon the fact that he occupied
himself with other branches of science. It was in
vain that Samuel sent to Judæa a festival calendar
calculated for sixty years; Jochanan remarked
slightingly, when the fact came to his knowledge:
"At any rate he is well acquainted with arithmetic."
It was not until Samuel forwarded several
scrolls, filled with investigations of certain little-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">523</a></span>known
diseases of animals, that he began to be
respected.</p>

<p>It was during this period (the third century) that
there occurred simultaneously in the Roman and
Parthian empires certain political catastrophes
which were attended with the most important
results. Through their influence history acquired
an altered aspect, and considerable changes were
effected in the state of things existing in these two
countries and their dependencies. It was impossible
for Jewish history to remain unaffected by
these events. During the reign of the noble
Alexander Severus occurred the overthrow of the
Parthian dynasty, which, beginning with Arsaces,
had subsisted during four centuries. A new and
more vigorous race seized the scepter, and this
change of dynasty gave rise to many revolutions
both at home and abroad. The author of these
changes was Ardashir, or Arbachshter, as he was
called in his own language, a descendant of the
race of ancient Persians (Arians). Such of the
Persians as still remained true to their nationality,
nourished a hatred against the impure dynasty of
Arsaces, on account of the semi-Grecian origin of
its members, their leaning to Greek views in matters
of religion, their contempt for the national faith,
and finally, their impotence to check the ever-increasing
conquests of the Romans. It was with
them that Ardashir united himself and conspired
to overthrow Artabanus, the monarch who entertained
so great a reverence for Rab. A decisive
battle was fought, in which Artabanus succumbed,
and the neo-Persian dynasty of the Sassanides was
founded by the conqueror. The race which thus
obtained the upper hand is known in history by the
name of the neo-Persians; the Jewish authorities
called them Chebrim (Chebre), and a deteriorated
residue of the stock still subsists in India under the
name of the Guebres. This revolution was attended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">524</a></span>
by results as important in matters of religion as in
politics. In place of the indifference with which
the ancient rulers had regarded the primitive worship
of fire, Ardashir manifested an ardent enthusiasm
for it. He proudly called himself "the
worshiper of Ormuz, divine Ardashir, the King of
the Kings of Iran, the offspring of a heavenly race."
He ordered such of the parts of the ancient Persian
law (the Zend-Avesta) as were still extant to be
collected, and commanded them to be regarded as
the religious code. Zoroaster's doctrine of the
twin principles of light and darkness (Ahura-Mazda
and Ahriman) was everywhere enforced; the
Magi, the sacerdotal caste of this cult, recovered
their credit, their influence, and their power, while
the partisans of the Greeks were persecuted with
fire and sword. The fanaticism which was thus
aroused in the Magians also caused them to direct
their hostile attacks against the Christians, who
resided in great numbers in the districts of Nisibis
and Edessa in upper Mesopotamia (conquered
by the Romans), and who possessed their own
schools.</p>

<p>The Jews were not entirely exempt from the
attacks of this fanaticism, and only escaped severe
persecution through their solidarity, their centralization,
and their powers of defense. In the first
intoxication of victory the neo-Persians deprived
the Jewish courts of the criminal jurisdiction which
they had been permitted to exercise until then;
the Jews were admitted to no offices, and were not
even allowed to retain the supervision of the canals
and rivers, but they do not seem to have complained
very bitterly of these measures. They were even
compelled to submit to restraints upon their freedom
of conscience. On certain festivals, when the
Magi worshiped light in their temple as the visible
representation of God (Ahura-Mazda), the Jews
were not suffered to maintain any fire on their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">525</a></span>
hearths, nor to retain any light in their rooms.
The Persians forced their way into the houses of
the Jews, extinguished every fire and collected the
glowing embers in their consecrated braziers,
bringing them as an offering to their temple of
fire. They also dug the corpses out of the graves,
because, according to their notion, dead bodies
lying in the bosom of the earth desecrated this
"Spenta Armaita" (holy soil). For these various
reasons the majority of the teachers of the Law
were not greatly prepossessed in favor of the neo-Persians.
When Jochanan heard that they had
triumphantly invaded Jewish Babylonia, he was
greatly concerned for the fate of his Babylonian
brethren, but his anxiety was allayed by the assurance
that the Persians were very poor and would
therefore easily allow themselves to be bought off
with bribes. By reason of their semi-savage state
he referred to them as "the abandoned people into
whose hands the Babylonian communities had been
delivered." Levi bar Sissi, who was continually
traveling to and fro between Judæa and Babylon,
was anxiously questioned by the Patriarch Judah II
as to the character of the conquering race. With
obvious prepossession in favor of the vanquished
Parthians, he described them and the victorious
neo-Persians in the following words: "The former
are as the armies of King David, but the latter
resemble the devils of hell." Little by little, however,
the fanaticism of the neo-Persians moderated,
and there sprang up between them and the Jews
so sincere a friendship that on their account the
latter relaxed the severity of the Law, and even
assisted now and again at their banquets. The
teachers of the Law permitted the Jews to deliver
up fuel which the Magi demanded of them on the
occasion of the Festival of Light, and ceased to
consider this act as a furtherance of idolatry, though
it would certainly have been regarded as such by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">526</a></span>
the old Halacha in similar cases. Even Rab, the
essence of strictness, acquiesced in the demand of
the Magi, and allowed the lamps to be brought
from the open street into the houses on the Sabbath
on the occasion of the Festival of the Hasmonæans,
in order not to give offense to the prejudices of the
ruling sacerdotal class. This mutual toleration,
doubtless, first made its appearance under the rule
of Shabur I (242&ndash;271), the liberal-minded monarch
whose friendship with Samuel has already been
mentioned. This magnanimous king assured
Samuel that during the many wars which he had
waged against the Romans in countries thickly
populated with the Jews, he had never spilt Jewish
blood, except on the occasion of the capture of
Cappadocia, when 12,000 Jews had been put to
death as a punishment for their stubborn resistance.</p>

<p>The radical changes which occurred about this
time in the Roman empire were also attended with
important effects and reactions on Jewish history.
The death of Alexander Severus was the signal for
anarchy, the many-headed hydra, to rage in all its
terror in Rome and the Roman provinces. During
the short space of half a century (235&ndash;284) the
throne was occupied by nearly twenty emperors
and as many usurpers, who willingly laid down their
lives to obtain the gratification of their desire to
wear the purple, if only for a day, and to decree
executions by the hundred. From nearly every
nation which Rome had subjugated there arose an
emperor who enslaved the Italian Babylon. The
time of retribution had come; the birds of prey
were contending for the putrefying body of the
State. It was during the time of Samuel (248) that
the thousandth anniversary of Rome was celebrated
by the assassin-emperor Philip, an Arab by birth
and a robber from his childhood; but Rome was
powerful wherever its legions were stationed,
except in Rome itself, the city whose senate was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">527</a></span>
obliged to accept with smiling face the humiliations
which it experienced at the hands of the soldier emperors,
and to sanction them in servile humility by
Senatus-Consulta. The Roman empire was invaded
on the one hand by the Parthians, on the other by
the Goths, as if in fulfilment of the sibylline threats
of punishment.</p>

<p>Valerianus had undertaken a campaign with the
intention of recovering the districts which had been
conquered by Shabur. Rome now experienced the
further disgrace of seeing her emperor fall into his
enemy's power, and suffer all the humiliations of
slavery at the hands of the haughty victor. In the
eastern provinces, in the neighborhood of the
mighty Persian empire, disorder and dissolution had
reached a still higher degree. A rich and adventurous
native of Palmyra, Odenathus by name, had
collected a band of wild and rapacious Saracens
around him, and he and his troops made frequent
incursions from his native city into Syria and Palestine
on the one side, and the region of the Euphrates
on the other, plundering and laying waste the
country through which they passed. Odenathus
had already assumed the title of Senator. Why
should he not become the emperor of the Romans,
like his fellow-countryman Philip? Odenathus was
known in Jewish circles as the robber captain,
"Papa bar Nazar," and to him was applied the
passage in Daniel's vision: "The little horn coming
up among the greater horns, and having eyes like
the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great
things." The predatory incursions of this adventurer
were accompanied by results which were
highly detrimental to the Jews of Palestine and
Babylonia. He demolished the ancient city of
Nahardea (259), which had formed the central point
of the Jewish communities ever since the time of
the Babylonian exile. It was many years before
this town was able to recover itself from this
destructive blow. The Amoraim of Nahardea,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">528</a></span>
Samuel's disciples, were obliged to take to flight;
they emigrated to the region of the Tigris. They
were&mdash;Nachman, a son-in-law of the Prince of the
Captivity, Sheshet, Rabba b. Abbuha, and Joseph
b. Chama.</p>

<p>On the occasion of the destruction of Nahardea
by Odenathus, Samuel's daughters, doubtless together
with many others, were taken prisoners by
the enemy and brought to Sepphoris. The freebooters
speculated on heavy ransoms, which appeared
to them more lucrative than the sale of the
captives in the slave market, for it was well known
that the Jews spared no expense in order to procure
the release of their fellow-countrymen. Samuel's
daughters had derived so much benefit from their
father's profound knowledge of the Halacha that
they succeeded in escaping the application of a
strict law, which placed all maidens who had been
taken prisoners on the same footing with those who
had been dishonored, thus incapacitating them from
contracting a spotless marriage. Before it was
known whose daughters they were they had already
recovered their freedom, and their assertion that
their innocence had received no taint at the hands
of the rough warriors was readily believed. When
Chanina heard in Sepphoris that they were Samuel's
daughters he strongly enjoined a relation of theirs,
Simon b. Abba, to marry one of them.</p>

<p>Odenathus, the destroyer of Nahardea, gradually
became a petty Asiatic prince of Palmyra or Tadmor,
the oasis which King Solomon had converted into a
city. The Roman empire was so feeble and tottering
that it was this hitherto disregarded warrior who
was obliged to oppose a bulwark to the conquests
of the Persians on Roman territory. The great
services which he thus rendered to the empire compelled
his recognition (264) as co-emperor by
Gallienus, a monarch characterized by his weakness
and love of satire. Odenathus did not long enjoy
this high dignity, for in 267 he fell by the hand of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">529</a></span>
an assassin, instigated, as the story went, by Zenobia,
his wife. After his death the regency devolved upon
Zenobia, her two sons being still minors. Through
her influence Palmyra, the city of the desert, was
transformed into the home of imperial pomp, culture,
and refined taste. A Christian report represents
the empress Zenobia as a Jewess, but the Jewish
authorities make no mention of this fact. No colors
seem to be vivid enough for the Roman accounts
of Zenobia in order to paint the picture of her
strange personality. The palace of this second
Semiramis, the ruins of which still bear witness to
refined and artistic taste, was the meeting-place
of original-minded geniuses, with whom the queen
delighted to hold philosophical intercourse.</p>

<p>At her court resided Longinus, the refined and
philosophical lover of the fine arts, who in his
æsthetic work on the Sublime was unable sufficiently
to express his admiration of the poetical contents
of the Biblical account of the Creation, "Let there
be light." Paul of Samosata, Bishop of Antioch,
when accused of heresy, also found shelter at her
court. Zenobia, his patroness, also seems to have
had some leaning towards the fundamental truth of
Judaism. The Jews were, nevertheless, not particularly
well disposed towards the court of Palmyra.
Jochanan, although not blind to the beauties of
Greek, gave utterance to the most unfavorable
opinions concerning the Palmyrene state: "Happy
will he be who sees the fall of Tadmor." Subsequent
generations were at a loss to explain this
aversion.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that many Jews took up
arms against Zenobia, whose rule must also have
extended over Judæa. It is related that a certain
Zeïra bar Chanina having been brought up before
Zenobia to receive sentence for an offense which
seems to have been of a political nature, two of
Jochanan's disciples, Ami and Samuel, presented
themselves before the empress, in order to intercede<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">530</a></span>
on his behalf and obtain his liberation. They were
most ungraciously received, however, by Zenobia.
"Do you think," said she, "that because God has
worked so many miracles for your nation you can
hazard everything, simply putting your trust in
Him?" Another occurrence, which is related by
the same authority, seems also to have taken place
during Zenobia's reign. A certain Ulla bar Kosher,
of whom no further mention is made in history, was
prosecuted for a political offense, and fled to Joshua
ben Levi in Lydda. So much importance must,
however, have attached to his capture that a troop
of soldiers surrounded Lydda, and threatened to
destroy the city if the fugitive were not delivered up
to them. In this sad dilemma in which the life of a
single individual must either be sacrificed or the
safety of an entire community endangered, Joshua
ben Levi prevailed upon Ulla to give himself up.
He justified this course of conduct by referring to a
Mishnaic law which permits the surrender to the
political power of a culprit specially designated, in
the case of many lives depending on such compliance.
But the Jewish conscience, symbolized by the prophet
Elijah, refused to take any part in bringing about
the death of a man. Elijah, the ideal of pure zeal
for Judaism, appeared to Joshua ben Levi and inspired
him with remorse for having allowed himself
to deliver up the culprit; he ought not to have relied
solely on the simple preceptive law, but should
also have been mindful of the "Mishna of the Pious,"
which widened and elevated their views concerning
the precepts of duty.</p>

<p>Zenobia's reign, after enduring brilliantly for
several years (267&ndash;273), was brought to a termination
by Aurelian, who gained a hard-earned victory
over the haughty empress, and brought her in
golden fetters to Rome to figure in his triumph.
Jochanan lived to see the fulfilment of his wish
regarding Tadmor, and died a few years after its
fall (279).</p>

<p>The period during which Christianity emerged from
the position of a persecuted community and acquired
that of an established church, marks a crisis in the development
of the history of the world, and forms an
epoch of transition also in the history of the Jews.
The influence exerted by the mother-country began
gradually to decline. It was Babylonia that now occupied
the universal interest, while Judæa became a holy
antiquity; it still possessed the power of arousing
glorious memories, but was no longer the scene of
memorable deeds. The teachers of this generation,
indeed, were not few, including in their numbers the
disciples of Chanina, Jochanan, and Resh-Lakish;
and the youth of Babylonia, smitten with a holy
longing, still preferred the schools of Palestine to
those of their native land. But only very few of
the principals of the schools were possessed of any
eminence, and the most important of them, Ami,
Assi, Chiya b. Abba, and Zeïra, were all Babylonians
by birth. Abbahu, the only one who was a native
of Judæa, was a person of much originality, but of
no authority in the Halacha. The superiority of
Babylon was so readily acknowledged that Ami and
Assi, the leaders of Judæa, of their own accord subordinated
themselves to Rab's successor. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">532</a></span>
Babylonian novices excelled their masters in the
knowledge of the Law; Sora and Pumbeditha took
the lead of Sepphoris and Tiberias. Even the
Patriarchs of this period, Gamaliel IV and Judah
III, possessed but an insignificant knowledge of the
Law, and were both obliged to receive instruction from
Amoraim. Under Judah the duty of examining
witnesses concerning the appearance of the new
moon degenerated into a mere pretense and a
formality. When Ami expressed a desire that this
duty should be seriously fulfilled, the Patriarch informed
him that he had often understood from
Jochanan, that as soon as, according to astronomical
calculation, the thirtieth day was ascertained to be
the beginning of the new month, it was permissible
to press a witness into declaring that he had perceived
the new moon, although this was not the
case. The accurate calculation of the Festivals
gradually made this burdensome custom of the examination
of witnesses so superfluous that Judah's
successor was able to entirely abrogate this duty of
the Patriarchate. Of more importance appeared
to Judah the ordering of the affairs of the communities
and the schools, and to this point he devoted
his entire attention. He commissioned the
three principal Amoraim, Ami, Assi, and Chiya, to
undertake a journey through the cities of Judæa, in
order to inspect the various institutions of a religious
or educational character, and to restore them in
those places where they were falling into decay.
In one town, where the envoys found neither
teachers of the people nor of the young, they summoned
the elders to bring before them the guardians
of the city. On the armed guard of the town being
brought into their presence, the envoys of the Nasi
exclaimed: "These are in nowise the guardians
of the city, but its destroyers; the true guards are
the teachers of the young and of the people; 'If
God protect not the house, in vain watcheth the
warder.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">533</a></span>
The Patriarchate of Judah III falls in the reign of
Diocletian and his co-emperor, who, by the strength
of their rule and their sincere devotion, delayed for
a time the decline of the Roman empire. Diocletian
was not unfavorably disposed towards the Jews.
He was, perhaps, all the more tolerant to them in
proportion as he hated and persecuted the Christians;
these latter he considered as the sole cause
of the dissolution of the Empire, on account of their
persistent struggle against the Roman state religion,
and their zeal for conversion. The rigorous edicts
which this monarch considered it necessary to
decree during the last years of his reign (303&ndash;305),
and which aimed at compelling the Christians to
adopt the worship of idols, at closing their churches,
and at prohibiting their meetings for divine service,
did not include the Jews within their terms, although,
curiously enough, the Samaritans do not seem to
have escaped their action. Nevertheless, the enemies
of the Jews appear to have exerted themselves
in order to prejudice Diocletian against them. The
emperor was secretly informed that the Patriarch
and his companions made merry over his obscure
parentage and his surname Aper (Boar), concerning
which the emperor was especially sensitive. The
story relates that the emperor, highly exasperated,
commanded the Patriarch and the most distinguished
members of the community to appear before him on
a Saturday night, at Paneas, about twenty miles
from Tiberias. As this command was not communicated
to them until late on Friday, they found
themselves in the desperate dilemma of undertaking
a journey on the Sabbath, or disregarding the imperial
summons. On their arrival at Paneas, Diocletian
ordered them to bathe themselves for several
days previous to appearing before him in audience.
This insult was intended as an allusion to the uncleanliness
with which the Jews were reproached.
When at last they were brought before the emperor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">534</a></span>
the Patriarch and his companions assured Diocletian
of their loyalty and faithfulness, and they are said
to have convinced him that they had been iniquitously
calumniated, whereupon he graciously dismissed
them (about 297 or 298).</p>

<p>By reason of the constraint of sacrificing to the
gods, under which Diocletian laid both Samaritans
and Christians, the former were completely and forever
excluded from the Jewish community. A
peculiar fate controlled the relations of these two
kindred and neighboring races, and prevented them
from living on good terms for any length of time.
At any moment which appeared favorable to mutual
advances, trifling circumstances were sure to arise
which widened the breach between them. After
the destruction of the Temple the two peoples lived
in tolerably good relations with one another; the
Samaritans were admitted to be in many respects
strict Jews. The war of Hadrian united Jew and
Samaritan even more closely, and this friendly relation
took so deep a root, that Meïr's decision to
regard the Samaritans as heathens never gained
general acceptance. Daily intercourse and business
connections had bound them closely to each other.
Even Jochanan did not hesitate to partake of meat
prepared by the Samaritans. His successors were,
however, more severe, and contrived to bring about
a separation from the Samaritans. The occasion of
this rupture is said to have been as follows: Abbahu
having once ordered some wine from Samaria, an
observation was made to him by an old man that
the Law was no longer strictly observed in that
country. Abbahu communicated this intimation to
his friends, Ami and Assi, who investigated the
matter there and then, and determined to declare
the Samaritans as heathens, irrevocably and in
every respect. This was perhaps the last resolution
arrived at by the Synhedrion. No mention is made
of the Nasi in connection with this decree, thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">535</a></span>
affording a further proof of the insignificance of the
authority enjoyed by him, and of the depth to which
the Patriarchate had fallen. This disunion had the
effect of weakening both Jews and Samaritans.
Christianity, shrewder and more active than its
parent, Judaism, and more refined and supple than
Samaritanism, its sister, gained the empire of the
world soon after this rupture, and Jew and Samaritan
alike felt its superior power. Golgotha, raised
upon the height of the Capitol, pressed with a two-fold
burden on Zion and Gerizim.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the slight respect in which the
Patriarchate of Judah III (280&ndash;300) was held, a
phenomenon makes its appearance for the first
time, which betrays indeed the poverty that
existed in Palestine, but on the other hand shows
the adherence of the Jews to the Patriarchal house
of David, the last remnant of their ancient glory.
It had always been the custom to announce to such
communities as were situated at a distance, the
resolutions arrived at by the Synhedrion, and
especially the period of the festivals, by means of
special messengers (Shaliach Zion, Apostoli). As
a rule, men of merit and members of the Synhedrion
were chosen to fill this honorable post, for they
represented the highest authorities, and were also
required to explain and apply the various resolutions.
The more the numbers of the Jews in the
Holy Land were lessened by revolts and wars, and
the greater the part of the country that fell into the
hands of the heathen, the more also that extortionate
taxes spread poverty far and wide, the
greater difficulty the Patriarchs found in defraying
the expenses of their office from their own
private means. They were obliged to turn to
the wealthy communities of other countries to
request contributions for their support. Originally,
perhaps, these aids constituted a voluntary contribution
(aurum coronarium), forwarded by the communities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">536</a></span>
as a proof of allegiance on the occasion
of the accession of a Patriarch as prince of the
Jews. About this time, however, Judah III found
himself obliged to send messengers to raise a
regular tax (canon, pensio). Such an envoy was
Chiya bar Abba, whom the Patriarch Judah authorized
and sent abroad armed with peculiar powers:
"We send you an excellent man, who possesses
equal authority with ourselves until he return unto
us." This same Chiya was, in fact, an excellent
man, as poor in means as he was rich in character.
It was only on account of grievous necessity that
he allowed this post to be conferred on him by the
Patriarch, and its acceptance constituted in so far a
sacrifice that he was obliged to quit the Holy Land,
which he had chosen as his residence in preference
to his native country. During a long period he was
supported by a rich and charitable family of Tiberias,
named Silvani (Beth-Silvani), who furnished him, as
a descendant of Aaron, with the tithes of the produce
of their property. On a certain occasion,
however, Chiya forbade them to commit a deed
which another teacher of the Law declared to be
lawful; and they, in return, made him feel his dependency
on their tithes. Upon this he determined
never again to accept tithes from any one, and, in
order to avoid temptation, he resolved to quit
Judæa.</p>

<p>It is in this Amora that a singular fault may first
be remarked, which later on became more general,
and produced the most disastrous consequences.
Chiya b. Abba, namely, was so absorbed in the
study of the oral Law, that in his devotion to it
he neglected the reading of the written Law, the
Bible. Being once asked why the word "good"
does not occur in the first Decalogue, he made
reply that he hardly knew if this word really did
not occur in that place. Chiya bar Abba was of a
gloomy disposition, and in the Halacha he followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">537</a></span>
the severe tendency which refused even to allow
Jewish maidens to acquire the culture of the Greeks,
although Jochanan himself had permitted it, and
even encouraged it to a certain extent.</p>

<p>It may be noticed, as a sign of the times, that
the heads of the schools at Tiberias were not
natives of the country, but Babylonians who had
emigrated thither from their own land. Ami and
Assi occupied the post formerly filled by Jochanan,
their master. They delivered their lectures in the
peristyles, which certainly dated at least from the
period of the Herods. But these buildings, which
had been crowded with listeners in Jochanan's time,
now testified to the declining importance of the
Holy Land. Babylonia was the goal of such of the
youth of Judæa as were desirous of studying. Ami
and Assi only bore the modest title of "the Judges,
or the respected descendants of Aaron in the Holy
Land," and of their own accord subordinated
themselves to the Babylonian authorities.</p>

<p>Of greater importance and originality was Abbahu
of Cæsarea on the Sea, who was a striking
contrast to Chiya and Simon, Abba's sons. He
was wealthy, kept Gothic slaves, and had ivory seats
in his house; his trade was the manufacture of
women's veils. He understood Greek perfectly,
which was the case with but few of his contemporaries;
he frequented the society of educated
heathens, and had his daughter taught Greek. He
considered the knowledge of this language as an
ornament to an educated girl, and supported his
opinion by citing Jochanan's permission. The
austere Simon bar Abba, who was hostile to all
worldly education, reproved this conduct in the
following terms; "He attributes this permission to
Jochanan, because his daughter is learning Greek."
In answer to this attack upon his veracity, Abbahu
protested that he had really received this tradition
from Jochanan's lips. By reason of his familiarity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">538</a></span>
with contemporary civilization, which many people
regarded as sinful, a verse of Ecclesiastes was
applied to him: "It is good that thou takest up
this (the study of the Halacha) and neglectest not
that (the learning of the Greeks), for the pious are
able to fulfil all duties." The Greek language was
in fact so current among the Jews of Cæsarea, that
they even recited the passage of Scripture relative
to the unity of God (the Shema) in this tongue.</p>

<p>Abbahu was held in great esteem by the Roman
Proconsul, and probably also by the Emperor
Diocletian, on account of his profound learning,
which was heightened by the charm of a dignified
figure and a generous character. By means of this
influence with the authorities he was enabled to
avert many severe measures. A case of this description
affords at the same time an insight into the
general state of things at this period. Ami, Assi,
and Chiya bar Abba, having once pronounced a
severe punishment on a woman named Thamar, who
was doubtless guilty of some breach of chastity, were
denounced by her to the then Procurator, on a
charge of encroaching on the jurisdiction of the
Romans. The Jewish judges, fearful for the consequences
of this denunciation, besought Abbahu to
exert his influence on their behalf. He, however,
answered that his efforts had failed to produce any
effect, by reason of the existing desire of revenge,
perhaps also on account of the beauty of the culprit.
His reply was couched in characteristic terms,
being so conceived that, at first, the words do not
convey their actual meaning. The import of this
document was in brief as follows: "I have settled
everything as regards the three slanderers&mdash;Eutokos,
Eumathes, and Talasseus&mdash;but I have labored
in vain on behalf of the obstinate and refractory
Thamar." The language of this letter, which is a
model of the style of that period, is for the most
part pure Hebrew embellished by a play upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">539</a></span>
words; the Greek proper names are translated into
the approximate Hebrew terms. This style, when
handled with skill, invests the Hebrew tongue with
an inimitable charm; but it easily degenerates into
empty pomp and trifling, which was already in
Abbahu's age to some extent the case.</p>

<p>By reason of his extensive acquirements Abbahu
was well fitted to engage in polemics against Christianity.
During the time of Diocletian, Christianity
had strained every nerve to obtain the empire of
the world. The Roman legions were in part composed
of soldiers who had adopted this religion,
and Christianity therefore redoubled its efforts to
obtain proselytes. Setting itself up in opposition
to Judaism and heathenism, it brought down upon
itself severe punishment at the hands of Diocletian
and his co-emperor Galerius, on account
of its arrogance. The Jews were possessed of intellectual
weapons, and these they employed as
long as they were permitted their free use. Like
Simlaï, Abbahu attacked the Christian dogmas in
the most uncompromising manner, and grounded
his opposition, according to the manner of the time,
upon a verse in the Bible (Numbers xxiii. 19): "If
a man say of himself, 'I am God,' he lieth; 'I am
the son of man,' he will repent it; 'I go to heaven,'
he will not confirm it." The doctrine of the
Ascension was especially a disputed point between
the teachers of the Church and the synagogue, and
its defender in Cæsarea was Jacob the Minæan, a
physician by profession. In order to authenticate
the Ascension, the Christians brought forward the
Agadic tradition, according to which Enoch ascended
into heaven without dying: in the words of
the Bible, "and he (Enoch) was not, for God took
him." They used this ambiguous phrase in support
of their opinion. Abbahu, however, proved by parallel
verses that, according to the true exegesis, the
expression contained in this verse amounted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">540</a></span>
nothing more than a figure of speech for "to die."
In the succeeding generation Abbahu might, perhaps,
have paid with his life for his bold truthfulness
and his exact interpretation.</p>

<p>Abbahu was one of those modest, gentle, yielding
characters who are the less conscious of their own
merit in proportion as it is great. When it was
proposed to ordain him as Rabbi, he withdrew in
favor of Abba of Acco, desiring first to see the
distinction conferred upon the latter, who by this
promotion would have been able to free himself from
the burden of debt with which he was oppressed.
Another event brings out yet more strongly
evidence of his unassuming disposition. He was
once delivering discourses, concurrently with Chiya
b. Abba, in a strange town, the subject being
treated by the latter according to the Halachic
method, while he adopted the more edifying style
of the Agada. As was only natural, the popular
discourses of Abbahu, being intelligible to all, were
better attended than Chiya's lectures, which were
more difficult of comprehension. The latter having
manifested some irritation at the neglect which fell
to the lot of his discourses, Abbahu attempted to
console him in the following words: "Thy teaching
resembles the most precious stones, of which there
are but few good judges; mine, on the contrary, is
like tinsel, which delights every one." In order to
appease him still further, Abbahu showed his
offended companion all possible attention and marks
of honor throughout the day; nevertheless, Chiya
was unable to forget the slight which he considered
had been inflicted on him. This anecdote cannot
be regarded as altogether unimportant, proving as
it does the decay of serious studies in Judæa at
this time. The Halacha, the study of which
wrinkled the brow and exercised the mind, no
longer found listeners, and was obliged to quit the
field before the light-winged Agada. Abbahu was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">541</a></span>
even unwilling to lay any stress upon his modesty.
He once exclaimed: "With all my boasted humility,
I am still far behind Abba of Acco, for he is not
even angry with his expositor (Meturgeman) when
the latter dares to make his own additions to the
analyses which are whispered to him." A flaw had
thus made itself apparent in that method of teaching,
which had formerly invested the discourses with so
much solemnity and merit. Instead of being merely
the organ of the lecturer, the Meturgeman permitted
himself to introduce his own views into the
expositions. A complaint was made that the interpreters
only accepted their office out of conceit, in
order to display their fine voice or their flowery
language. This condition of things was aptly
described in the following verse: "It is better to
hear the severity of the wise than the song of
fools." From this habit of the interpreters, the
lectures degenerated into an empty word jingle.</p>

<p>Abbahu's generous and thoroughly noble views
may also be gathered from another characteristic
sketch, which at the same time affords a faithful
picture of the customs of the period. It was
usual on the occasion of a drought, an event of
not uncommon occurrence in Judæa, for the most
meritorious member of the community to offer up
the prescribed prayers for rain. The person who
on one occasion was recommended to Abbahu as
the most worthy, happened to be a man of the
worst fame, known to the wits as the "five sins"
(Pentekaka). Being summoned before Abbahu,
and questioned by the latter respecting his occupation,
he admitted his infamous calling. "I am,"
said he, "a go-between; I clean out the play-house,
carry the clothes to the bathers, divert the bathers
with jokes, and play upon the flute." "And hast thou
never done a good deed in all thy life?" demanded
Abbahu. "One day," said Pentekaka, "when I
was cleaning the theater, I saw a woman leaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">542</a></span>
against a column and weeping. In answer to my
inquiry as to the cause of her grief, she told me
that her husband was a prisoner, and that there
was nothing left for her to do in order to procure
his release but to sacrifice her honor. As soon as
I heard this," continued Pentekaka, "I sold my bed,
my coverlet, everything that I had in the world,
gave the proceeds to the woman, and said to her:
'Go, free thy husband without paying the price of
sin.'" At these words Abbahu could not contain
himself, and exclaimed to Pentekaka, that medley
of sublime virtue and vulgar dishonor: "Thou alone
art worthy to pray for us in our trouble."</p>

<p>The theater at this period participated in the
general immoral tone of the times, and was by
no means a nursery of culture or refinement;
buffoons diverted the crowd, and Judaism was often
laid under contribution to furnish a subject for their
coarse jokes. Abbahu, who was acquainted with
events which occurred outside the Jewish world,
complained of the frivolous manner in which Jewish
institutions were held up to ridicule, and cites,
among others, the following examples. A camel
was brought into the theater in mourning trappings;
thereupon ensues the following dialogue: "Why is
the camel in mourning?" "Because the Jews, who
strictly observe the Sabbatical year, cannot even
get herbs to eat, and are obliged to live upon
thistles. The camel mourns because its food is
thus snatched away." Enter Momus (the buffoon)
with his head shaved. "Why does Momus mourn?"
"Because oil is dear." "And why is oil so dear?"
"Because of the Jews. They consume everything
on the Sabbath that they have earned during the
week; not even wood enough remains for them to
cook their food; they must, therefore, burn their bed,
and being without a bed, must sleep upon the ground
and wallow in the dust; in order to avoid uncleanliness,
they use a great deal of oil, and that is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">543</a></span>
reason that oil is so dear." Thus had the degenerate
Greeks prostituted the art of Aristophanes!</p>

<p>Abbahu also possessed a certain reputation in
the study of the Law, but did not rank as an
authority; his province was the Agadic exegesis.
By reason, however, of his influence in the political
world, his colleagues flattered him to excess&mdash;fearing
to correct him even when he committed errors
in teaching. It appears that Cæsarea, where Ushaya
the elder had formerly established a temporary
school, was now elevated by Abbahu to a par with
Tiberias as an academical city, where the greatest
Amoraïm of Palestine assembled. The synagogue
in Cæsarea, whence had proceeded under Nero
the first movement of revolt against the Romans,
resulting eventually in the loss of independence to
the Jewish state, was perhaps Abbahu's academy,
and it appears to have still borne the fatal name of
"the Revolution synagogue" (Kenishta di-meradta).
In the same way as Simon bar Abba was accustomed
to misfortune, Abbahu was attended by good
luck, which did not forsake him even in his old age.
He had two promising sons, Abimaï and Chanina.
The latter was sent by him to Tiberias for the
purpose of perfecting his education; but instead
of applying himself to study, Chanina spent his
time in burying the dead, whereupon his father
reprimanded him in a letter which is remarkable for
its laconic brevity: "Has Cæsarea, then, no graves,
that I should be obliged to send thee for this
purpose to Tiberias? Study must precede practical
work." Abbahu was the last important personage
of Judæa during Talmudical times. For fifteen successive
centuries it had given birth to intellectual
giants, judges, generals, kings, prophets, poets,
soferim, patriots, teachers of the Law. It now
ceased to produce, and brought forth no new celebrities
into the world. When Abbahu died, says
the legend, the statues of Cæsarea wept for him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">544</a></span>
In Babylonia, on the contrary, the lively ardor
and activity begun by Rab and Samuel, the founders
of the study of the Law in their native land, continued
to increase after their death. During the
half-century over which their labors had extended,
the study of the Law had taken so deep a root that
the plant throve better in foreign than in its native
soil. A lively emulation to acquire a knowledge
of the Law, and to regulate their life by this
standard, possessed all classes of society. It was
accounted the highest honor to be recognized as a
master of the Law (Zorba-me-Rabbanan), and the
greatest disgrace to be reckoned among the ignorant.
The immorality which had formerly obtained
in Jewish Babylon vanished together with the gross
ignorance, and domestic and public life fashioned
itself according to the ideal which had been inculcated
with such enthusiasm by the two great
teachers, Rab and Samuel. Babylonia assumed,
in many respects, the rôle of the Holy Land,
even as regards the contributions to the priests,
which seem, however, to have been applied to
the uses of the teachers of the Law: learning
was of more account than the priesthood. Babylonia
had become a regular Jewish state, whose
constitution was the Mishna, and whose public
props were the Prince of the Captivity and the
school assembly. This impetus to a higher life also
communicated itself to the princes of the captivity,
and they likewise applied themselves to the study
of the Law. Nehemia and Ukban, Rab's grandchildren,
and Nathan, their father, were appointed
Resh-Galutas in this generation; by reason of their
intimate knowledge of the Halacha they received
the title of honor of Rabbana. This happy movement,
which permeated all classes of Jewish society
in Babylonia, was a sign that Judaism was not yet
dead, but still possessed sufficient vigor to put forth
new shoots. It was furthered to the utmost of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">545</a></span>
their power by the successors of Rab and Samuel,
of whom the most prominent were: Huna, who was
the chief teacher of the Sora academy, and at the
same time was regarded as religious head both in
Babylon and abroad; Judah ben Ezekiel, who
founded a new school in Pumbeditha, and introduced
a new method of studying the Halacha; Nachman
b. Jacob, who transferred his academy to Shekan-Zib
on the Tigris, after the destruction of Nahardea
(259); and finally Chasda, Sheshet, and Rabba bar
Abbahu. Almost all of these Amoraïm possessed
their own peculiar tendency, and thus variety and
diversity were introduced into the narrow circle of
scholars in the Babylonian schools.</p>

<p>Huna was born about 212, at Dio Kart, and died
in 297. He was Rab's successor in Sora, and the
authority of this period, to whom, as already narrated,
the Amoraïm of Judæa voluntarily subordinated
themselves. The story of his life presents
at once a perfect picture of the manners of this
period, and shows how indefatigable zeal for the
Law went hand in hand with secular occupations,
with agriculture and other industries. Although
related to the Prince of the Captivity, Huna was
not originally wealthy. He cultivated his small
field with his own hands, and was not ashamed of
his labor. He used to remark to his visitors, who
came to him to judge their differences, "Bring me
a man to till my ground and I will be your judge."
Often he returned home from the field with his
spade upon his shoulder. He was once perceived in
this condition by Chama b. Anilaï, the richest, and
at the same time the most charitable and generous
man in Babylonia. This liberal man almost realized
the ideal in his exercise of the Jewish virtue of
being a father to the poor. Bread was baked day
and night in his house for the relief of the poor,
doors were placed on all sides, so that all who were
needy might enter, and he who came hungry into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">546</a></span>
the house left it satisfied. When Chama went out
he held his hand continually in his purse, so as not
to be obliged to keep those who felt ashamed to ask
for charity in a painful situation while he was searching
for his money.</p>

<p>At the time of the famine he caused wheat and
barley to be left about at night for such persons
as were prevented by their sense of honor from
mixing with beggars. If an extraordinary tax was
to be levied, Chama was certain to take a large
share of the burden upon his own shoulders. This
beneficent person possessed so much modesty, notwithstanding
his extraordinary wealth, that whenever
he met Huna returning from his labor, with
his spade upon his shoulder, he begged to be
allowed to carry it for him, out of reverence for the
principal of the school. Huna, however, never
permitted him to do this: "Thou art not accustomed
to do such a thing in thine own town, therefore
will I not allow it here."</p>

<p>Later on Huna grew rich, and had his fields
cultivated by laborers, who received a portion of the
crops; his cattle grazed on the steppes of South
Babylonia. He employed his wealth in the most
noble manner. On stormy days, when the winds
which blow from the Syrian desert devastated the
country and covered the city with ruins, he used
to go about in a litter, in order to inspect the houses
in Sora, and pull down any walls which might be in
a falling condition. If the proprietors were not in
a position to build their houses up again, Huna
would have it done at his own expense. During
the hours of meals, all the doors in his house were
left open, and it was announced in a loud voice that
all who were needy might enter and be satisfied.
Other tales are related of his eager and assiduous
charity. The indigent scholars who attended his
school, which was situated in the neighborhood of
Sora were maintained at his expense during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">547</a></span>
months of study, although their numbers were
anything but small. Eight hundred attended his
lectures, and there were thirteen expositors placed
in different parts of the building, whose duty it was
to make the discourse audible and intelligible to the
whole assembly. The profound reverence with
which his noble character, his erudition, and his
modesty inspired his friends, was nevertheless
incapable of blinding them to his faults, however
small they were. The teachers of the Law were
extremely severe with regard to one another's
conduct, and were unrelenting towards any of their
number who did not come up to the ideal of the
Law.</p>

<p>It was during the time of Huna that public life in
Babylonia, which was in most intimate connection
with the schools, became organized in a manner
that was unchanged for almost eight centuries.
Gradually and involuntarily there was formed a
hierarchy of the principal and subordinate dignitaries.
The school, which met, as already mentioned,
during certain months of the year, was
called the Metibta (session), and the principal
member of this assembly was known as the Resh-Metibta
(Director). Next in rank to the President
came the Reshe-Kalla (Professors), whose duty
consisted in elucidating during the first three weeks
of the Kalla month, the theme which the Principal
would take as the text of his discourses. The
judicial offices were separated from the professorships;
as justice was still meted out, according to
ancient custom, before the gates of the city, the
judges were called, by reason of this circumstance,
the <i xml:lang="he" lang="he">Dayane-di-Baba</i> (Judges of the Gate). In
matters of theory they were subordinate to the
Principal; they were appointed by the Prince of the
Captivity, on whom they were dependent in matters
of practice.</p>

<p>For forty years Huna presided over the Metibta,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">548</a></span>
and by reason of his undisputed authority, Babylonia
became completely independent of Judæa.
He boldly acted upon the principle which his master
Rab had been unable to carry through, and placed
Babylonia on a footing of equality with Judæa as
regarded the Law. "We consider being in Babylon
just the same as being in the Holy Land," was a
principle first established by Huna. He thus broke
the last tie that united the land of the captivity to
the mother-country, or perhaps it would be more
accurate to say that he merely gave expression to
the actual state of things, for, as a matter of fact,
Babylonia far surpassed Judæa. Only as a mark
of respect, or in case it was desired to obtain a
solemn sanction of an opinion, was it usual in
Babylonia to obtain a decision from the Holy Land.
During the period over which Huna's labors extended,
the Sora Metibta bore sway in Babylonia.</p>

<p>Huna died suddenly (297) when over eighty
years of age, leaving his fame and his virtues to his
son Rabba. The highest honors were paid to his
remains by his friends and pupils. The funeral
discourse opened with the following words: "Huna
deserved that the Holy Spirit should descend upon
him." His corpse was carried to Judæa, probably
in execution of his dying wish; there it was met by
the most distinguished men, such as Assi and Ami,
who procured its interment in the vault of Chiya,
another Babylonian. It gradually became a pious
custom to be buried in Judæa's holy earth, to which
was attributed an expiatory power. The resurrection
was confidently expected to take place
in that country, which, it was also believed, would be
the scene of the coming of the Messiah. Those who
had died in unhallowed countries would roll about in
the light, loose earth, until they reached the Holy
Land, where they would again be revivified. In
place of living inhabitants, who were continually
decreasing, Judæa was becoming every day more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">549</a></span>
thickly populated with corpses. The Holy Land,
which had formerly been one immense temple,
inspiring great deeds and noble thoughts, was now
a holy grave, which could render nothing holy but
death. Of the numerous sanctuaries which had
formerly existed, the dust alone now remained as an
object of veneration. The entire central region of
Judæa, the mountains of the King, was so exclusively
inhabited by heathens, that it was proposed
to declare it exempt from the tribute to the priests.</p>

<p>The antithesis and complement to Huna was his
younger comrade, Judah ben Ezekiel (born 220,
died 299). Although he had been a disciple of
Rab, Judah seems to have inclined more to Samuel,
whose characteristics he inherited. He possessed
a strongly marked personality, and was highly
talented, but at the same time had so many angles
and edges that he was continually coming into
collision with persons and circumstances. He was
the descendant of an ancient Jewish stock, which
was, perhaps, able to trace back its origin to families
mentioned in the Bible, and for this reason he was
unusually susceptible on the point of nobility of
blood and purity of descent. A friend of simplicity
in most matters, he vehemently attacked all
who gave the preference to artificial refinement.
Although he held the Holy Land in great reverence,
he nevertheless blamed those who left Babylonia in
order to be educated in the schools of Judæa, and
was unrelenting towards such of his friends and
pupils as emigrated thither. Judah founded for the
first time an academy in Pumbeditha, which city,
since the destruction of Nahardea, had become the
center for northern Babylonia, as Sora was for the
south. The Pumbeditha school, which, under Judah,
was second only to the Soranian, attained in later
times to the position of the leading academy. For
nearly eight centuries it asserted its pre-eminence
with but few intermissions, and was almost the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">550</a></span>
remnant of Jewish antiquity which beheld unmoved
the birth of a new epoch.</p>

<p>True to the character of the inhabitants of his
native city, Judah ben Ezekiel allowed the intellect
to predominate so greatly over the heart, that he
only consecrated one day in each month to prayer,
the rest of the time being devoted to the study of
the Law. He had already been distinguished by
Samuel as the "acute," and later on became the
creator of that acute system of dialectics which in
former times had gained a transitory acceptance in
Judæa, and now became current in and indigenous
to Babylonia. This system differed materially from
that employed by the Tanaites, for it went direct
to the heart of the matter, while the other clung to
the formulæ of the rules of interpretation. Judah's
discourses were confined solely and simply to the
treatment of matters of jurisprudence, as occult
comparisons and distinctions, deductions and applications,
here find their proper place, and theory
and practice go hand in hand. The remaining
portions of the Mishna were neglected at Judah's
school; he seems, in fact, to have experienced a
sort of aversion to studying such parts of it as
contained Halachas treating of the laws of Levitical
purity which had fallen into disuse. Under Judah's
influence, the extensive subject-matter of the Law
shrank to the contracted dimensions of a sphere in
which nothing was included but what was applicable
to reality and everyday life. He introduced the
precise custom of communicating not only the
matter of the traditions, but even the names of the
persons who had handed them down. Nevertheless,
it is remarkable that his own brother, Rami (R. Ami),
questioned the accuracy of the traditions handed
down by him, and even gave him the lie direct.
"Accept not the decrees," he would often exclaim,
"which my brother Judah puts forward under the
name of Rab or Samuel; but thus and thus were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">551</a></span>
they handed down." In another respect also, Rami
was the opponent of his brother; he quitted Babylonia
and emigrated to Judæa, although Judah
severely censured such a course, which, he considered,
constituted no slight crime against religion.
He even regarded the return of the Babylonian
exiles under Ezra and Zerubbabel as a violation of
the Law, and considered that it had better never have
come about; for the prophet Jeremiah had impressed
on the captives that they should also die
in Babylon. The only excuse which he found for
the pious Ezra and his emigration was the assertion
that the latter had led to Judæa such families as
were of doubtful origin, in order to prevent their
intermarrying with those whom he left behind.</p>

<p>As has already been mentioned, another of
Judah's peculiarities was an extreme severity with
regard to the purity of the race. He was so particular
on this point that he delayed marrying his son
Isaac long after the latter had reached maturity,
because he was not certain whether the family from
which he desired to procure him a wife was spotless
beyond all dispute. Upon this point his friend
Ulla pertinently remarked: "How do we know for
certain that we ourselves are not descended from
the heathens who violated the maidens of Zion at
the siege of Jerusalem?" Judah's punctiliousness
with regard to purity of descent caused him many
a vexation. There once came to Pumbeditha a
distinguished citizen of Nahardea, who claimed to
be descended from the Hasmonæans, perhaps from
the unfortunate king, Hyrcanus II, who had resided
in Babylonia for several years. This Nahardean,
who was connected with the most esteemed families
of his native town, was exceedingly vexed that
Judah ben Ezekiel should be conceded the priority
on every occasion, and once exclaimed scornfully:
"Who is this Judah bar Sheveskeel?" When this
tale came to Judah's ears, he excommunicated the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">552</a></span>
Nahardean for his irreverence, and when he heard
that the latter actually called all persons slaves, he
was so carried away by his passion that he publicly
stigmatized him as a descendant of slaves. In
consequence of this insult, the Nahardean complained
to Nachman, the son-in-law of the Prince
of the Captivity. Nachman, who was as overbearing
as Judah was passionate, sent the latter a summons
to appear before him to justify his conduct. The
Principal of Pumbeditha was not a little astonished
at thus being called upon to give an account of his
conduct to Nachman, who was not only younger,
but of less consequence than himself. Huna, however,
with whom he took counsel, prevailed upon him
to comply with this summons out of regard for the
Prince of the Captivity.</p>

<p>Owing to his profound learning, his acuteness
of intellect, and his estimable character, Judah
enjoyed undisputed authority both in Babylonia and
abroad. When Huna died Judah was chosen by
the Sora Metibta as their Principal (297); under him
and his successor there was but a single academy
which was recognized by every one. His authority
was recognized even in Judæa. He once excommunicated
a certain distinguished member of the
Metibta whose reputation was attacked. When the
latter visited him on the occasion of his last illness,
he openly stated that he was proud of having
spared not even such a man out of regard for his
position. As Judah died without having raised the
ban, it was necessary to appeal to the Patriarch, in
accordance with the custom which obtained in such
cases. Judah had only held the office of general
Resh-Metibta for two years when he died at a ripe
old age.</p>

<p>The college elected in Judah's place the octogenarian,
Chasda of Cafri (born 217, died 309).
He was one of Rab's disciples, and entertained so
great a reverence for his teacher that he committed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">553</a></span>
to memory all the decisions which the latter had
ever given, and promised a reward to any one who
would communicate to him any unknown trait of
"our great master," as he called him. Chasda is
known as the most fortunate of the Amoraïm.
Originally poor, he was afterwards blessed with
such extraordinary gifts of fortune that his wealth
became proverbial. Sixty marriages were celebrated
in his house, and it is said that no member
of his family died during his lifetime. Although he
had attended Huna's discourses, his method of instruction
rather resembled that employed by Judah;
he was extremely fond of acute explanations.
Chasda's superiority over Huna, which he caused
the latter to feel on one occasion, contributed to the
creation of an estrangement between the two, which,
it is said, lasted for forty years. In consequence
of this difference Chasda appears to have withdrawn
from Sora to the neighboring town of Cafri,
but there he felt isolated and slighted. Once when
the college of Sora appealed to him for his opinion
of some dubious case, he took offense and exclaimed:
"What! do you even pick up damp wood? Probably
you expect to find a treasure beneath it."
While Huna still held the post of Principal, Chasda
erected a school in Sora at his own expense (293),
but he still retained the position of disciple with
regard to the former, and gave no decisions in
practice. It was not until Judah's death that he
was appointed Principal of the college; he held this
office for ten years, and died in 309 at the age of
ninety-two.</p>

<p>His Halachic opponent was Mar-Sheshet, who
like himself had been a disciple of Rab and a pupil
of Huna. Sheshet's memory was so retentive that
he knew by heart not only the whole Mishna, but
also all the Boraïtas. Whenever Chasda and Sheshet
met, the former was dismayed at his opponent's
imposing array of Boraïtas, while the latter trembled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">554</a></span>
at Chasda's subtle expositions. He was, in fact, a
sworn enemy of that hair-splitting style of teaching
which Judah had introduced into the Pumbedithan
school, and which had quickly degenerated into
mere subtilty. Whenever a person started any
specious objection, Sheshet would ironically inquire:
"Comest thou not from Pumbeditha, where they
can pass an elephant through the eye of a needle?"
Sheshet's relations with the Resh-Galuta of this
period afford a striking proof of the neglect into
which religious practices had fallen in the house of
the Prince of the Captivity, and of the uncouth barbarity
which still continued to rule there. Whenever
the Resh-Galuta invited Sheshet to partake of
his hospitality he was met by a repeated refusal.
Upon being urged to explain the cause of this
incivility, Sheshet answered that the slaves of the
Resh-Galuta had not yet abandoned the custom of
cutting the meat that was to be served in the
banquet from living animals. Although the Prince
of the Captivity may have been ignorant of this
barbarous habit of his servants, it is nevertheless
apparent that he paid no great attention to the
religious conduct of his household. It was not
unusual for the slaves of the Prince of the Captivity
to indulge in practical jokes at the expense of the
teachers of the Law who visited their master, often
shutting them up in the dungeons. Nothing further
is known of Sheshet, except that after the destruction
of Nahardea he founded a school at Silhi on the
Tigris.</p>

<p>The youngest member of this circle of the
Amoraim was Nachman ben Jacob, one of Samuel's
disciples (born about 235, died 324). He was the
representative of that haughty self-reliance of the
Babylonian Jews, which was founded upon their
prosperity, their independence, and the certainty of
a livelihood. He was a son-in-law of the Prince of
the Captivity, whose daughter, Yalta, he had married<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">555</a></span>
after the death of her first husband, and he possessed
to the full the pride, ostentation, and arrogance
characteristic of the princely house. Like
any oriental prince, he was attended by eunuchs,
ready at a moment's notice to make their master's
exalted position felt by any one who should dare
depreciate his reputation. He had been appointed
chief judge by his father-in-law, and was so proud
of this dignity, that when his colleagues attempted
to place themselves on an equality with him, he
forcibly reminded them that he alone was competent
to act as judge. He even did not hesitate
to decide many cases without the assistance of his
colleagues, although it was considered an arrogant
act to sit in judgment alone. His character was
devoid of gentleness and humanity. Once when
the slaves of the Resh-Galuta had forcibly dispossessed
an old woman of some building materials, in
order to erect a tabernacle therewith, he was appealed
to by the latter to award her redress for this
violation of the Law: "The Prince of the Captivity
and his doctors," said she, "are sitting in a stolen
tabernacle." Nachman, however, scarcely listened to
her; whereupon she pointedly exclaimed, "I am the
daughter of a man (Abraham) who possessed 318
slaves, and cannot even find a hearing for my complaint!"
To this remark Nachman returned a
harsh answer, and finally decreed that at most she
was only entitled to compensation for the stolen
materials. He was even less considerate in his
treatment of his slaves, whose sense of human dignity
he outraged in a manner revolting to morality.
His female slaves were not permitted to contract
any lasting union, but were given in turn to different
men, according as such changes were considered
to afford a better chance of profit. In this he
was entirely unlike his master, Samuel, who united
his male and female slaves in lawful wedlock for life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">556</a></span>
Even the teachers of the Law were treated by
Nachman with imperiousness and disdain. His wife,
Yalta, the daughter of the Prince of the Captivity,
had, contrary to custom, committed her child by her
first husband to the custody of a nurse, so as to be
able to marry Nachman. She even exceeded her
husband in pride, and possessed all the whims and
insolence of a petty oriental princess. She exacted
homage of the learned men with whom her husband
associated; and when, on one occasion, Ulla withheld
his respects, she insulted him of set purpose.
He was in the habit of making frequent journeys
between Palestine and Babylonia, and was probably
also poor. It was with reference to these two
points that Yalta observed of him, "Travelers are full
of twaddle, and rags of vermin."</p>

<p>Jewish jurisprudence is indebted to Nachman for
an important decision, the account of the origin of
which affords some indication as to the state of
morality at this period. According to the principles
of the old Jewish code, when a person was summoned
before the court to answer for a debt, and insufficient
evidence was forthcoming against him, he was only
allowed to purge the charge by an oath, if he partially
admitted the claim; if he repudiated it altogether,
no oath could be administered. This law
was based upon the assumption that every one was
actuated by motives of patriarchal probity, which
rendered them incapable of the audacity of openly
repudiating a just claim. But this simple honesty
could no longer be assumed to exist; on the contrary,
it had been supplanted by a certain wily
cunning, which succeeded, by reason of the wide-spread
knowledge of the Law, in availing itself of the
letter in order to evade the spirit. It was for this
reason that Nachman, profiting by experience, introduced
the oath of purgation (Shebuot hesset) in
those cases where the claim was totally denied, and
this decision eventually obtained the force of law.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">557</a></span>
As has already been mentioned, Nachman emigrated
from Nahardea after its destruction, and established
himself in Shakan-Zib, the inhabitants of which were
notorious for their love of mockery. It is not related
whether he again transferred his residence to
Nahardea, after that city was restored.</p>

<p>A connecting link between Judæa and Babylonia,
of which two countries the former was slowly
declining while the latter was gradually coming to
the fore, was formed by Zeïra, who was the highest
authority in Judæa during the following generation.
The history of this man brings into prominent relief
the opposition existing between the mother-country
and the Babylonian colony. He had been a pupil
of Huna and Judah, but was dissatisfied with the
method of teaching employed in Babylonia, and
yearned for the simple method of the Amoraïm,
which obtained in the schools of Galilee. He hesitated
to quit Babylonia, however, in deference to
Judah's dislike of emigration. When, at last, he
stole away, so to speak, from his native country,
his longing to behold the Holy Land was so irresistible,
that he ventured to cross the Jordan by a
rope, so as not to lose time in searching for a
bridge. A Christian who was witness of the traveler's
haste, remarked reprovingly to Zeïra: "You
Jews have not yet abandoned your old fault of precipitancy,
which showed itself among you at Mount
Sinai"; whereupon the latter rejoined: "Ought I
to delay a single moment to enter the Holy Land,
the sight of which was not even vouchsafed to
Moses and Aaron, our teachers?"</p>

<p>Arrived at Tiberias, Zeïra endeavored to forget
the minute analysis which constituted the Babylonian
method of teaching. The legend adds that
he fasted for forty days, in order to give weight
to his prayers, in which he entreated that the
hateful Babylonian system might vanish entirely
from his memory. Judæa and its peculiar method,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">558</a></span>
on the other hand, seemed to him to be surrounded
with a halo of glory, and "the atmosphere of the
Holy Land appeared to him pregnant with wisdom."
The characteristic tendency of Babylonia, however,
had gained so strong a hold on his mind that he
was unable to free himself from it, even in Judæa.
However greatly he strove to acquire the simplicity
of the Judæan method, he never succeeded in
entirely eradicating the influence of the Babylonian
rational analysis, and it was on account of this very
superiority which he himself failed to recognize, that
he was held in high esteem by the Amoraïm of
Judæa. The dignity of teacher was conferred upon
him within a very short time. His modesty was so
great, however, that, like King Saul, he hid himself,
and only consented to be ordained when it was
represented to him that remission of sins was
attached thereto. In the encomium which it had
become customary to recite on the occasion of an
ordination, allusion was made to Zeïra's small,
insignificant figure, in the following terms: "Without
brilliancy, without glitter, but not without charm."
He became one of the authorities of Judæa, together
with Ami, Assi, and Abbahu, all of whom he outlived.
At his grave a poet recited an elegy, which
shows better taste than most of the verses produced
on similar occasions; it ran somewhat as
<span class="locked">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="center bpad">320&ndash;375 <span class="smcap smaller">C.&nbsp;E.</span></p>

<p>The period during which Christendom asserted its
triumphant sway marked a decisive crisis in the
history of nations, and closed also an epoch in
Jewish history. The harvest which had slowly and
invisibly been maturing during the preceding centuries
was now ripe. Christianity, although hated
and persecuted, had still remained defiant, and at
last disarmed its enemies by drawing them within
the circle of its influence. The Roman Empire,
which seems to have felt an instinctive dread of its
approaching dissolution through the religion of
Christ, submitted to baptism, thus prolonging its
assigned length of existence by the space of a
century and a half. Heathenism, which was nourished
by and in turn bred irrational ideas, deceit,
and immorality, was obliged to surrender its life
of shams, and make room for another form of
religion.</p>

<p>The new religion which thus pressed triumphantly
to the fore, possessed innumerable advantages
over heathenism, in that it laid down in theory
as a fundamental principle, a worthier conception
of God and a purer morality, although it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">560</a></span>
very far from conforming in practice to these
tenets. At the same time as Rome and Italy lost
their importance and retained only a shadow of
their former greatness, Judæa and Tiberias, which
had taken the place of Jerusalem, sank into insignificance.
Like Italy, the seat of heathen civilization,
Judæa was impoverished and stunted by Christianity.
By means of the political power to which
this religion now attained&mdash;the possession of the
imperial dignity placing the axe of the lictors and
the sword of the legions under its command&mdash;Judæa
was soon deprived of its intellectual life, and
the school of Tiberias lost the power of attraction
which it had so long exercised, and sank into
decadence.</p>

<p>While Babylonia was raised during the next fifty
years to the pinnacle of its fame by the exertions
of three original Amoraïm, Rabba, Abayi, and
Raba, the Judæan Amoraïm of this period were of
no importance. The few men of these times
whose names have survived are Chaggai, who
became an authority by reason of his age, Jonah II
and José, the disciples and successors of Ami and
Assi. The sole recognized authority of Judæa was
Jeremiah; but he was an emigrant from Babylonia,
where he had been so little appreciated that he
had been turned out of the schools. The office of
Patriarch also sank at this period into complete
insignificance, its holder, Hillel II, having in imitation
of his great-grandfather Hillel, self-denyingly
resigned a portion of his power. It is
remarkable that at the same time as the Patriarchate
lost all consequence in Judæa, it acquired a showy
splendor abroad, as if the corpse were being
adorned before being lowered into the grave.
During the last century of the existence of the
office, the Patriarchs received the pompous titles of
"Highness" (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">illustres</i>), "Worshipful" (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">spectabiles</i>),
"Famous" (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">clarissimi</i>), which titles they enjoyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">561</a></span>
in conjunction with the highest dignitaries of the
State, with whom, to all appearances, they were
thus placed on an equality. "Let him who dares
to publicly insult the illustrious Patriarchs be visited
with severe punishment," commands an imperial
edict, which, although dating from a later period,
rests nevertheless on the earlier legislation affecting
the Patriarchs.</p>

<p>The Emperor Constantine, who had aggrandized
the Church, and laid the dominion of the earth at
her feet, had at the same time given her the doubtful
blessing, "By the sword thou shalt live."
He had originally placed Judaism, as a religion, on
an equal footing with the other forms of worship
existing in the Roman Empire. For, before adopting
the Christian faith, and determining above all
things to put a stop to religious persecutions
throughout his dominions, Constantine had published
a sort of edict of toleration, wherein he had
commanded that every man should enjoy the right
of professing any religion without thereby becoming
an outlaw. The Jews were likewise included in
this act of toleration, and their patriarchs, elders,
and the principals of the schools and synagogues
enjoyed the same privileges as the Christian ecclesiastics
and the heathen priests. These decisions continued
in force, and in later times were sanctioned
by new laws, although another spirit began to sway
the newly-founded Byzantine court. The rule was
established that the members of the synagogue who
dedicated themselves to the Law, the Patriarchs,
Priests, and other religious officials, should be
relieved from all municipal and other onerous
offices. Taking as models the constitution of the
Roman priesthood, and the Christian system of
bishops, the Patriarch of Judæa was regarded as
the chief of all the Jews in the Roman Empire.
Constantine's impartial justice, however, lasted but
a short time. The more Christianity asserted its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">562</a></span>
influence over him, the more did he affect the
intolerance of that religion, which, forgetful of its
origin, entertained as passionate a hatred of Judaism
and its adherents as of heathenism. Sylvester,
Bishop of Rome, Paul, afterwards Bishop of Constantinople,
the new capital, and Eusebius of
Cæsarea, the first historian of the Church, did not
fail to incite the inhabitants of the empire against
the Jews. Judaism was stigmatized as a noxious,
profligate, godless sect (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">feralis</i>, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">nefaria secta</i>)
which ought to be exterminated from the face of
the earth wherever possible. An imperial edict was
published to the effect that the Jews were no longer
to make converts, those entering, as well as those
receiving newcomers into the faith being threatened
with punishment (315). Finally the proselytism of
the Christians was afforded the aid of the State, and
the Jews were forbidden to pronounce upon such
of the members of their community as apostatized
the punishment which Christianity was, however,
permitted to inflict in a terribly aggravated degree
upon its own adherents who left its fold. "All who
dare attack the apostates with stones or in any
other manner, shall be delivered to the flames,
together with their accomplices." It was impossible,
in fact, that Jews without fixed opinions
should not be tempted by Constantine's decided
leaning towards Christianity, and the prospect of
profit, to change their religion. The Church
expressly aimed, by all sorts of promises, at
seducing the weaker members of the Jewish community
from their faith, laying especial emphasis
on the disadvantages which would accrue from
adherence to Judaism, and on the benefits which
the apostate would derive from the State. "Why
do you suffer death for your God? See to what
punishments and pillagings He has condemned
you! Come to us; we will make you dukes, and
governors and captains." "The sinful Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">563</a></span>
Empire, the son of thy mother, attempts to make
the faithful waver," such were the texts from which
the public orators of the synagogue had henceforth
to preach. The privileges of the Jews were abolished
by Constantine&mdash;as, for instance, in the city
of Cologne&mdash;and it was decreed by him that, with
the exception of two or three men, all of them were
liable to be called upon to fill the burdensome
municipal offices.</p>

<p>Then the world witnessed the hitherto undreamt-of
spectacle of the first general convocation of Nice,
consisting of several hundred bishops and priests,
with the emperor at their head (325). Christianity
thought to celebrate its triumph, but only succeeded
in betraying its weakness and internal disunion.
For on the occasion of this, its first official appearance,
in all the splendor of its plenitude of spiritual
and temporal power, there remained no trace of its
original character. The Essenean doctrine of humility,
brotherly love, and community of possessions;
the Pauline zeal for morality and sound opinions;
the ardor of the Alexandrian school for scientific
erudition;&mdash;all had vanished. Dogmatical disputes,
whether Christ the Son was equal to the Father,
whether he resembled or differed from him, disputes
all the more bitterly carried on because of the impossibility
of settling the question either way,&mdash;these
were the points which henceforward constituted the
foreground of the history of the Church which was
destined to represent the history of the world.
At the Council of Nice the last thread was snapped
which connected Christianity with its parent stock.
The festival of Easter had up till now been celebrated
for the most part at the same time as the
Jewish Passover, and indeed upon the days calculated
and fixed by the Synhedrion in Judæa for its
celebration; but in future its observance was to be
rendered altogether independent of the Jewish calendar,
"For it is unbecoming beyond measure that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">564</a></span>
on this the holiest of festivals we should follow the
customs of the Jews. Henceforward let us have
nothing in common with this odious people; our
Savior has shown us another path. It would indeed
be absurd if the Jews were able to boast that we
are not in a position to celebrate the Passover
without the aid of their rules (calculations)." These
remarks are attributed to the Emperor Constantine,
and even though they may not have been uttered
by him, they were nevertheless the guiding principle
of the Church which was now to decide the
fate of the Jews.</p>

<p>The first utterance of Christianity on the very
day of its victory betrayed its hostile attitude
towards the Jews, and gave rise to those malignant
decrees of Constantine and his successors, which
laid the foundation of the bloody persecutions of
subsequent centuries. Constantine re-enacted&mdash;undoubtedly
at the instigation of the clergy&mdash;the
law of Hadrian, which forbade the Jews to live in
Jerusalem. Only on the anniversary of the destruction
of the city were they allowed, on making certain
payments to the officials, to mourn on the ruins
of the Temple. The clergy further succeeded in
obtaining a law from Constantine prohibiting the
Jews from making converts among the slaves.
Christianity claimed the monopoly of expansion,
and forbade Judaism to increase its influence either
by making proselytes or by converting its slaves.
Constantine seems, however, to have protected the
Jews against the arrogance of such of their brethren
as had gone over to Christianity; these converts,
for the most part possessed of no fixed opinions,
attempted to revenge themselves on their former
fellow-countrymen and co-religionists. One of these
apostates, Joseph by name, seems at this period to
have vigorously persecuted the Palestinean Jews.
He had been one of the assessors of the Patriarch
in the Synhedrion of Tiberias, and had been entrusted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">565</a></span>
with the honorable office of delegate and
envoy to the communities of Cilicia. There he had
frequently associated in secret with a bishop, and
had obtained the writings of the New Testament to
read. The Cilician Jews raised doubts as to his
orthodoxy, and as, in addition to this, he was not
greatly beloved, on account of his high-handed
treatment of the teachers and religious dignitaries,
some of whom he even degraded, certain of the
Cilicians entered his residence by surprise, and
discovered him reading the gospel. How is it possible
to blame the Jews of Cilicia for venting upon
his person their indignation at his deceit? They
are said to have thrown him into the river Cydnus,
and he is supposed to have escaped death only by
a miracle. Nothing now remained for Joseph but
to publicly announce his adoption of Christianity.
If he is to be believed, many Jews, including the
most learned and worthy among them, nourished at
this period a secret predilection for Christianity.
Joseph even relates a thoroughly incredible tale of
the aged Patriarch (probably Judah III), according
to which the latter was a secret adherent of the
religion of Jesus, and feeling a desire to be baptized,
he invited a bishop from the neighborhood of
Tiberias, under pretext of obtaining his medical
advice.</p>

<p>The Christian clergy of Palestine, and probably
the bishop Eusebius, who stood in high favor with
the emperor, took care that Joseph should be well
rewarded for his apostasy. Constantine conferred
upon him the dignity of Comes, which carried with
it a sort of immunity from punishment in case of
misdemeanor or violation of the law. He was also
granted permission by the emperor to build the first
churches of Galilee&mdash;at Tiberias, Sepphoris (Dio-cæsarea),
Nazareth, and Capernaum&mdash;where but
few Christians had hitherto resided.</p>

<p>The Patriarch's son and successor, Hillel II, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">566</a></span>
is said to have been still a minor at the death of his
father, was defamed by Joseph with a twofold purpose;
he desired, in the first place, to brand with
infamy, simply by the force of calumny, a fellow-countryman
of exalted position who had sufficient
reason to hate him; and secondly, he wished to
attest the miraculous power of the sign of the cross.
He is said to have been appointed guardian and
tutor to the young Patriarch, of whom he related
that, being led astray by his youthful companions,
he had abandoned himself to a life of indulgence,
and had even seduced honest and virtuous women
by the use of magical arts. This same Patriarch,
Hillel II, who flourished from about 320 to 365, was,
however, one of the most estimable successors of
the elder Hillel; he was certainly no votary of
Christianity, and was favored by an emperor who
likewise had reason to dislike the arrogant Church.</p>

<p>It was in reality under Constantius (327&ndash;330),
the fratricide and arch-persecutor of heretics, that
the Christian rule was introduced into the Roman
empire, and that the misfortunes of the Jews commenced.
If the champions of the Church had not
been blinded by vindictiveness and dogmatism, they
would necessarily have perceived that by accepting
the support of the political power they were acknowledging
the authority of a master and turning
the spear against their own breasts. The emperor
Constantius could boldly exclaim, "Let my will be
religion and the law of the Church!" It was not
the fathers of the Church who decided questions of
religion in the last instance, but the eunuchs and
the serving-women of the court. How could the
Jews expect humane treatment when the members
of the Church, from the emperor down to the most
humble of his subjects, were prompted by a spirit
of fanaticism to persecute one another on account
of verbal disputes? At the very beginning of Constantius'
reign, the Jewish teachers of the Law were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">567</a></span>
banished; in consequence of this decree several of
them emigrated to Babylonia. Among those who
were exiled there were two who are known by
name: Dimé and Isaac bar Joseph. These persecutions
seem to have been aggravated in the course
of time; the teachers of the Law were threatened
with death, whereby the stream of emigration from
Judæa was naturally increased. Abin and Samuel
bar Judah were among the later emigrants (337&ndash;338).
The consequences of these events were the decline
of the Academy of Tiberias and the general decay
of active teaching. Up till then there had still
existed a sort of Synhedrion, employing the usual
method of voting at its meetings; Haggai, Jonah,
and José are named as members of it.</p>

<p>The sentiment of hostility, nourished by Constantius
against the Jews, also manifested itself in
several laws concerning them. The causes of this
persecution remain involved in complete obscurity,
and it is impossible to ascertain whether the apostate
Joseph, that second Acher, was in any way
connected therewith. Marriages between Jews and
Christian women, which appear to have been of not
infrequent occurrence, were punished with death
under the emperor Constantius (339). Of even
greater consequence was the law concerning slaves
which was promulgated by him. Whereas his father
had only forbidden the admission of slaves into the
Jewish community, and had simply punished the
transgression of this prohibition by declaring forfeited
all slaves so admitted, Constantius decreed
(339) that the circumcision of a Christian slave
entailed the pain of death and the entire loss of
fortune. He even forbade the reception of heathen
slaves into the covenant of Judaism. The grounds
for this law were twofold: it was desired that
Judaism should receive no increase through its
adoption by slaves, and also that Christians should
not serve Jewish masters, "the assassins of God."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">568</a></span>
This preposterous view has been held by the Church
ever since, and prevails even at the present day,
although in another form. These restraints and
rigors were by no means legal, for the Jews were still
reputed citizens of the Roman empire, and in consequence
of this equality with the other inhabitants,
ought not to have been subject to any exceptional
laws. But what were right and law to this emperor,
who, as unscrupulous as he was weak, was swayed
by the eunuchs and the ecclesiastics of the court?
His conceits and caprices were law. Constantius,
or the ecclesiastics of his court, were the founders
of the Christian State.</p>

<p>The sufferings of the Jews became unbearable
when Constantius sent his cousin and co-emperor
Gallus to the East to operate against the ever-increasing
power of the Persians (351). Gallus,
who was addicted to debauchery, abandoned the
conduct of the war to his legate Ursicinus. The
latter, during three long years, worked more dire
distress in Judæa than any imperial master. As
the Roman legions were quartered in the cities of
Judæa, Ursicinus made it the duty of the Jewish
inhabitants to furnish the provisions necessary for
their maintenance, and prosecuted his demands
so inexorably that the Jewish communities were
thereby driven to violate the laws of their religion.
The Roman military officials demanded, for example,
that the troops should be supplied with new
bread, even on the Sabbath and the feast of unleavened
bread. The communities of Judæa were
so disheartened that the teachers of the Law vied
with one another in granting indulgences and
mitigating the severity of the Law. The two
authorities of Tiberias, Jonah and José, taught that
it was lawful to bake for Ursicinus' army on the
Sabbath; and the teachers of Neve, a Gaulanite
town, permitted leavened bread to be baked for
the legions during Passover. In their distress the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">569</a></span>
religious representatives quieted their consciences
with the excuse, which they deluded themselves
into believing, that the enemy did not expressly
demand the transgression of the Law, but simply
required the regular supply of the army. But
Ursicinus' intention appears really to have been to
institute a religious persecution, for at Senbaris, a
small town situated about four miles from Tiberias,
he burnt a scroll of the Law which had been
consecrated to the public use, and this act could
not relate in any way to the service of the army.
Besides this, an intolerable weight of taxes burdened
the Jews of Palestine, who were for the
most part greatly impoverished. Among these
burdens were the supply of natural produce (corn
and cattle), the payment of a poll-tax, of the tribute,
and, in addition thereto, of a tax levied on every
trade, and of all sorts of fines. The complaints
which were uttered against these onerous taxes
found an echo in the pulpit. "In the same way as
when a garment hanging on a hedge of thorns has
been disengaged from one side, it is immediately
torn by the other, so does it happen to us under
the rule of Esau (Rome). No sooner have the
supplies of produce been carried off than it is the
turn of the poll-tax, and before this has been paid,
the tribute is demanded. Wicked Esau behaves
with artful cunning towards Israel. Thou hast
stolen or killed. Thou hast not stolen? Who
stole with thee? Thou hast not killed? Who was
thy accomplice? Pay down thy fines, provide
supplies, pay the poll-tax and other imposts."</p>

<p>These multitudinous oppressions with which the
Jews were visited by the first Christian emperors,
inspired them with the courage of despair and
roused them to a fresh revolt. Although but little
is known of this rebellion and its consequences,
the accounts appearing to be but lightly sketched,
it is possible nevertheless to collect some isolated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">570</a></span>
particulars. The seat of the revolt was at Sepphoris,
where, under cover of the night, the Jews surprised
the Roman troops stationed there, slaughtered them,
and gained possession of their weapons. According
to one account the Jews were led by a chief of the
name of Patricius or Patrick (Netira), whom they
raised to the position of prince. Masters of the
mountain town of Sepphoris, they ventured upon
extensive incursions into the surrounding country,
with a view to revenging themselves on their
enemies for the outrages to which they had so long
been subjected. Similar revolts must also have
occurred at this time in the two most important
towns of Judæa, Tiberias and Lydda, as well as at
various other places. Thus the revolt acquired not
inconsiderable dimensions, and for this reason
Constantius was obliged to reinforce his colleague
Gallus with fresh legions. With the aid of these
troops the latter completely suppressed the rebellion,
but showed so little mercy to the vanquished
that not even the children were spared. Many
thousands of Jews fell as the victims of an insurrection
in which prudence had been overcome by
despair. Sepphoris was razed to the ground, and
Tiberias, Lydda, and the other cities which had
joined the rebellion were partially destroyed (352).</p>

<p>As had always been the case after similar rebellions,
those who had taken part in the revolt
were hunted down, so that none of them might
escape punishment; the inhabitants of Sepphoris,
being the originators of the rising, were most
rigorously sought out by Ursicinus. In order to
escape this persecution they made themselves
unrecognizable by masking their faces, and by this
means escaped detection for a while. At last,
however, traitors came forward and informed the
authorities of the deceit practised by the Sepphorians,
and the latter were accordingly seized
and executed on the spot. Many of the refugees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">571</a></span>
had meanwhile hidden themselves in the subterranean
passages of Tiberias, where they were safe
from the Romans. Huna relates: "When we took
refuge in the subterranean passages, we had torches
with us; if they showed but a feeble light, we knew
that it was day, while when they burned more
brightly we perceived that night was at hand."
According to this, the refugees must have passed
some time in these caverns.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Constantius appears to have re-enacted
Hadrian's edict against the Jews, for the
discharge of religious duties was prohibited, and
even the computation of the calendar and trade in
articles of religious use were forbidden. When it
was desired to inform Raba, who was at this period
the principal of the schools in Machuza, of the intended
intercalation of a month, and of the restraint
laid on the exercise of religion, it was necessary to
adopt a mysterious and enigmatical style, and to
make use of obscure allusions. The news was
communicated in the following terms: "Men came
from Reket (Tiberias), and the eagle (the Romans)
caught them; for they held in their hand that which
is fabricated at Luz (a blue-purple color for fringes).
But by God's mercy and their own merits, they have
nevertheless escaped in safety. The successors of
Nachshon (Patriarch) desired to appoint a supporter
of the months (intercalated month), but the Arameans
(Romans) would not allow it; notwithstanding
this, they assembled and intercalated the month of
the death of Aaron (Ab)." This secret epistle to
Babylonia betrays the distress which existed in
Judæa at this period. The dispersed and weakened
Synhedrion must have been prevented from inserting
the usual supplementary month in the spring
(Adar), and must have been compelled to transpose
it to some unusual season which had not been
sanctioned by the Law. On one occasion, about
this period, the Jews were forbidden to observe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">572</a></span>
the Day of Atonement, and were accordingly
compelled to postpone it till the Sabbath. This
condition of distress in which Judæa was plunged
was not at all altered when the barbarous Gallus
was put to death at Constantius' command, and
Ursicinus fell into disfavor (354). The adherents
of Judaism were regarded at the imperial court of
Constantinople as simple atheists, by reason of their
refusal to recognize Jesus. This view gave rise to the
law (357) that all Christians who joined the "blasphemous"
communities of the Jews should incur the
punishment of the forfeiture of their possessions.
The creatures of Constantius, Eusebius the chamberlain
among others, had specially aimed at the confiscation
of property, and they burdened the Jews
with illegal taxes, heavy beyond measure, hoping to
exterminate them by impoverishment and exhaustion.
New tables of taxes had already been drawn
up, with a view to still further increasing their
severity, on the pretext that as the Jews were
atheists they deserved no protection. They were
delivered from this oppression in an unexpected
manner by the Emperor Julian, who differed as
greatly from his brother Gallus, as from his cousin
and co-emperor, Constantius.</p>

<p>The miserable condition of Judæa was the occasion
of an act of self-renunciation on the part of the
Patriarch Hillel, which has not yet been thoroughly
appreciated. The custom had prevailed up till now
of keeping secret the computation of the new moon
and the leap year, and of making known the times of
the festivals to the communities in the neighboring
lands by announcing them by messengers. During
the persecutions under Constantius this method
had proved itself to be impracticable and useless.
Whenever the Synhedrion was prevented from fixing
the date of the leap year, the Jewish communities
in distant countries were left in utter doubt concerning
the most important religious decisions. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">573</a></span>
order to put a stop to all difficulty and uncertainty,
Hillel II introduced a final and fixed calendar; that
is to say he placed at every one's disposal the
means of establishing the rules which had guided
the Synhedrion up till then in the calculation of the
calendar and the fixing of the festivals. With his
own hand the Patriarch destroyed the last bond
which united the communities dispersed throughout
the Roman and Persian empires with the Patriarchate.
He was more concerned for the certainty
of the continuance of Judaism than for the dignity
of his own house, and therefore abandoned those
functions for which his ancestors, Gamaliel II and
Simon his son, had been so jealous and solicitous.
The members of the Synhedrion favored this
innovation; they only desired that the second day
of the festivals, which had always been celebrated
by the communities not situated in Palestine,
should not now be disregarded. José addressed
to the Alexandrian communities an epistle containing
the following words: "Although we have made
you acquainted with the order of the festivals,
nevertheless change not the custom of your ancestors"
(<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">i. e.</i> to observe the second day of the festivals).
The same recommendation was also made to the
Babylonians: "Adhere closely to the customs of
your fathers." This advice was conscientiously
followed, and the second day is observed by all the
non-Palestinean communities even at the present
time.</p>

<p>The method of calculating the calendar introduced
by Hillel is so simple and certain that up to
the present day it has not required either emendation
or amplification, and for this reason is acknowledged
to be perfect by all who are competent
to express an opinion on the subject, whether Jews
or non-Jews. The system is based upon a cycle of
nineteen years, in which seven leap years occur.
Ten months in every year are invariable, and consist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">574</a></span>
alternately of twenty-nine and thirty days; the
two autumn months only which follow Tishri (the
most important of all the months) are left variable,
as being dependent on certain circumstances in
astronomy and Jewish law. This and other computations
rest, however, on rules so simple, and are
so plain and easy, that the veriest tyro is thereby
enabled to draw up a calendar for a hundred, or
even a thousand years. It has not been ascertained
how much of this system was invented by Hillel,
and how much he owed to tradition, for it is indisputable
that certain astronomical rules were regarded
as traditional in the patriarchal house; in
any case, Hillel appears to have made use of
Samuel's calendar. This calendar and the year of
its introduction are now known. It was published
in the 670th year of the Seleucidean era, the 359th
of the common reckoning.</p>

<p>The oppression which thus fell upon the inhabitants
of Palestine, and which gave rise to Hillel's
calendar, augmented the importance and influence
of Babylonia, and although Christianity could boast
of having broken up the academies and destroyed,
so to speak, the Temple of the Law in Judæa, the
destruction was nevertheless merely local. In Babylonia
the study of the Law acquired so vigorous an
impetus that the achievements of ancient times were
almost eclipsed; the study of the Law was now
celebrating the period of its maturity. Two
methods of instruction in the traditions especially
had developed, namely, that of receiving the
authentic terms of the traditions and handing them
down in exactly the same words, and that of making
a fruitful application of the same, and of further
amplifying them. Each of these methods was represented
by one of the academies of Babylonia;
Sora was receptive, Pumbeditha creative. Altogether
Sora can be regarded only as a continuation
of the academies of Judæa, as a sort of Babylonian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">575</a></span>
Tiberias; and although the spirit which reigned
there underwent a change under the influence of the
Babylonian method, still the Soranian school never
furthered the cause of study to any appreciable
extent. It was Pumbeditha that raised learning to
its highest level. The acute scholars of Pumbeditha,
produced by Judah ben Ezekiel's Academy,
held sway at this period over Babylonia and the
dependent countries. The leaders and representatives
of this movement formed a triumvirate, consisting
of Rabba, and his comrades and disciples,
Abayi and Raba. It was these three that gave the
finishing touch to the work of completing the
Talmud, or rather who raised the study of the
Halacha to the rank of an intellectual system of
dialectics.</p>

<p>Rabba bar Nachmani (born about 270, died 330)
possessed, like the family to which he belonged,
certain original qualities. He was of a family from
Mamal or Mamala, a city of Galilee, the inhabitants
of which were for the most part descendants of
Aaron, and members of the family of Eli; they
asserted that they participated in the curse with
which this house had been visited, and which prevented
any of its members from ever attaining
extreme old age. Whoever went to Mamala was
astonished at seeing so many persons with black
hair; a grey-haired man was a rarity.</p>

<p>Rabba had three brothers, whose names were
Kailil, Ushaya, and Chananya; all of them lived
in the greatest poverty, which misfortune they also
ascribed to the curse resting on the house of Eli.
Ushaya, the younger, and Chananya, who had
returned to Judæa, obtained a precarious living as
shoemakers. By reason of the scarcity of customers,
they were sometimes obliged to sell their work to
prostitutes. Nevertheless, their minds remained so
pure and chaste that they were never reproached
with a single immodest glance; they were consequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">576</a></span>
held in high esteem, and were known as the
"saints of the land of Israel." These two brothers
applied themselves to the Agada, the favorite study
in Judæa, while Rabba, their sober brother, who as
a child had shown signs of great acuteness of
mind, evinced a predilection for the Halacha, in
which province his labor was epoch-making. He
had determined to remain in Babylonia, and his
brothers, unable to quiet their apprehensions concerning
his lot, used all their endeavors to persuade
him to come to Judæa. "It is not all one," ran
their message to him, "whether one dies in or out
of Judæa; for the Patriarch Jacob attached great
weight to being buried in the Holy Land. Although
thou art learned, still it is better to have a master
than to educate thyself. And if thou thinkest that
there is no teacher of importance to be found in
the academies of Judæa, we inform thee that thou
wouldst indeed find such a one here." In consequence
of this pressing invitation, and contrary to
the principles of Judah, his teacher, Rabba emigrated
to Judæa. Some time after, however, he returned
to Babylonia, probably because he was dissatisfied
with the Judæan method of teaching. Rabba's
worldly affairs are described as most miserable, and
are frequently contrasted with Chasda's uninterrupted
happiness.</p>

<p>After the death of his teacher Judah in 299, the
Pumbedithan College, which was composed of
lovers of dialectics, esteemed Rabba to be the only
person worthy of occupying the vacancy thus
created in the school. He was therefore offered
the honor of becoming Judah's successor, but his
exceeding modesty induced him to decline the post.
The vacancy was eventually filled by Huna ben
Chiya, whose wealth was so immense that he furnished
his audience in the lecture-room with gilded
seats. Although the greater number of the disciples
frequented Sora, the Pumbedithan Academy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">577</a></span>
nevertheless counted 400 students. Both Rabba
and his friend Joseph associated themselves with the
local academy, and subordinated themselves to the
principal, in order to prevent the school from being
deprived of the reputation which it had at last succeeded
in gaining. When it came to be known in
what manner Huna ben Chiya had acquired his
wealth, which had been amassed by the farming of
tolls, he was given to understand that the dignity
of teacher must not be stained by association with
that hateful trade, and that he must give up either
one or the other. Having abandoned the calling
of farmer of tolls, he was recognized by the college,
which followed Rabba's example, as a worthy principal
of the academy. Joseph was the only person
who refused to acquiesce in the appointment.
The not altogether spotless reputation of its principal,
however, threatened to become a cause of
ruin to the Pumbedithan Academy; care was therefore
taken after the death of Huna to make a better
choice, in order to enlist the sympathy of the people
and to attract a numerous audience. Two men
appeared worthy to fill this post, Rabba bar
Nachmani and Joseph ben Chiya, the one distinguished
for Talmudical dialectics, and the other
for Halachic erudition. The choice between the two
was so difficult that it was determined to take
counsel of Judæa, and the following question was
accordingly asked: "Who possesses the superiority,
Sinai (man of learning), or the remover of mountains
(man of acuteness)?" In Tiberias, where the
acute method of teaching, although not hated, was
nevertheless held in low esteem, the decision was
given in favor of the former. But Joseph entertained
scruples against accepting this dignity.
His nativity had once been cast by a Chaldean,
who had informed him that he would obtain a
position of great authority, but would not be able
to retain it longer than two years and six months,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">578</a></span>
after which he would die. In spite of the legal
prohibition forbidding credence to be given to the
wisdom of the Chaldeans, the most noted teachers
of the Law were unable to free themselves from
its influence; daily example was stronger than the
Law. Joseph having refused the post thus offered
to him, it was conferred upon Rabba (309), and in
him the Pumbedithan Academy found its ideal.</p>

<p>Rabba restored anew to the academy its extinguished
fame, and attracted to his discourses a
crowd of students, amounting at times to as many
as 1200. He did not confine his lectures to the
practical part of jurisprudence alone, as Judah had
done, but treated of all the subjects contained in
the Mishna; he sought to reconcile the various
contradictions existing in the Mishna, the Boraitas,
and the additions made by the Amoraic authorities
(Memra), and generally to introduce clearness into
the study of the Halacha. He even turned his
attention to the remote subject of the laws of
Levitical purity, which he succeeded in making
comprehensible; but in this branch of study, which
had vanished out of every-day life, he stood quite
alone, a fact that he frequently lamented. He was
distinguished by a desire to enter deeply into the
motives not only of the Pentateuch, but also of the
Sopheric and Mishnaic laws, and to draw conclusions
from them. The formulæ which he employed as an
introduction to these investigations ran as follows:
"Wherefore has the Law commanded this?" or
"Why are such-and-such things prohibited by the
teachers of the Law?" His luminous conception
and treatment of his subject invested it with life,
while the variety which he succeeded in imparting
to a dry theme by means of the occasional
introduction of an Agadic sentence made it both
interesting and captivating. At times he would
entertain the students with interesting anecdotes
before beginning his discourse, and as soon as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">579</a></span>
thought that he had put them in a cheerful temper,
he would begin to treat of more serious and weighty
subjects. His guiding principle was that the soul
must be prepared for the reception of serious
thoughts, and that this receptivity was best awakened
by cheerfulness. Rabba often put catch questions
to his pupils, or expressed paradoxical opinions,
in order to test their judgment or sharpen their
intellect. Rabba holds the same important position
among the Amoraim, as Akiba among the Tanaites.
He collected scattered and fragmentary
subjects under general heads. For this reason the
reverence in which he was held by the teachers of
the Law equaled that which was entertained for
the founder of Babylonian Jewish life. But in proportion
as he was beloved by this circle, he was
obnoxious to the populace of Pumbeditha. His
fellow-countrymen could not forgive this severe
censor for the sharp, reproachful words with which,
in his honesty and stern morality, he strove to
combat their deceits and artifices. Once, on the
occasion of a drought, when Rabba had proclaimed
a public fast, and had ordered prayers to be offered
up, without succeeding in obtaining rain, he exclaimed
reproachfully to the populace: "It is not
because we leaders of the people are worse than in
the time of my master Judah, that Heaven refuses
to gratify our wishes; nor is it because we are less
diligent in the study of the Law. But what can be
done by the representatives of the people when the
entire race is degenerate?"</p>

<p>On account of their needy circumstances Rabba
and another Amora, Ada, appear to have become
the colleagues (Chacham) of Mar-Ukban, a grandchild
of Rab, and at that time Prince of the Captivity,
at whose expense they were probably supported.
While the principals of the Soranian
Academy were wealthy, often supporting the entire
expenses of the schools, and maintaining a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">580</a></span>
number of disciples from their own purse, those of
Pumbeditha generally possessed but small means.
This circumstance necessitated the establishment
of an academical fund at Pumbeditha, to which
the communities and the Prince of the Captivity
probably contributed.</p>

<p>In Rabba's time the Babylonian Jews were the
victims of a transitory persecution, which, although
insignificant when compared with those which had
occurred in the Roman empire, was nevertheless
calculated to arouse the sufferers from their feeling
of profound safety. It was during the long reign
(310&ndash;380) of Shabur II, the new king of the Sassanian
dynasty, who had been acknowledged as ruler
while yet unborn, that the friendly relation in which
the Jews had stood to the Persian court became
disturbed, and it is possible that they would have
been as cruelly persecuted as the Christians, had
it not been that Ifra-Ormuzd, the king's mother,
was prepossessed in favor of Judaism and the
Jews. The account briefly narrates that a body of
troops marched into Pumbeditha, whereupon Rabba
and Joseph took to flight. A serious charge had
been brought against Rabba, the king or his
councillors having been secretly informed that, by
means of Rabba's discourses during the Kalla
months, his 1200 students had been induced to
evade the payment of the poll-tax. A royal bailiff
was sent out with orders to seize the person of the
principal of the Pumbedithan Academy. Being
warned in advance, Rabba fled, and in order to
escape detection he wandered about in the surrounding
country. His death was caused by fright
at the rustling of the wind in the trees, which the
fugitive mistook for the tramp of advancing soldiery.
Abayi and Raba, his most distinguished disciples,
together with the rest of the members of the
academy, went in search of his corpse, which they
eventually found covered over and hidden by birds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">581</a></span>
They mourned during seven days for this highly
esteemed Amora (330). The charge, which was
the occasion of Rabba's death, does not seem to
have been further prosecuted. The queen-mother,
Ifra, even sent a purse of denars to his successor,
leaving it to him to make the best and most pious
use of it, whereupon he employed it in ransoming
Jewish prisoners.</p>

<p>Rabba's successor and friend, Joseph ben Chiya
(born about 270, died about 333), was sickly and
sensitive, and possessed a passionate disposition.
He was aware of his failings and complained that
they prevented him from enjoying life. He seems to
have been very wealthy, and to have possessed fields,
palm-trees and vineyards, from which latter&mdash;as he
cultivated them more carefully than was generally
the case&mdash;he obtained better wine than was commonly
produced. Upon being afflicted with blindness,
he grieved less for the loss of his sight than
on account of his being thereby relieved from
performing various religious duties.</p>

<p>Joseph was exceptional among the principals of
the Pumbedithan Academy, inasmuch as he attached
more weight to the acquisition of a knowledge
of the Mishna and the Boraïtas by committing
them to memory, than to the drawing of ingenious
conclusions. For this reason he was known by
the title of "Sinai" and "Possessor of Storehouses."
Besides studying the Halacha, he turned
his attention to the Targum or Chaldaic translation
of the Holy Scriptures. The Torah, and probably
also isolated portions of the Prophets, which
were used for public reading (Haftara), had long
ago been translated into the Aramaic dialects&mdash;both
the Syriac and the Chaldaic. There existed
various Chaldaic translations of the Torah for the
use of those who were ignorant of Hebrew: one
of these, based probably on the favorite Greek
version of Akylas, bore the name of <i xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">Targum Onkelos</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">582</a></span>
the Syrian translation, employed by such
of the Jews of Syria and Mesopotamia as spoke
Syriac, was called <i>Peshito</i> (the simple). The
greater portion of the Prophets, however, had not
been translated, and it was Joseph who first took
in hand a Chaldaic translation thereof. Some persons
believed that this was a work of piety, as
Joseph was prevented by his blindness from reading,
and was unwilling to recite the Hebrew text
by heart, on account of the prohibition against
oral quotation of the written Law. He therefore
set about translating the Prophets on his own
account, in order to be able to quote any desired
passage in Chaldaic. Joseph's translation was
incorporated in the Targum, and was accepted as a
decisive authority on questions relating to the
explanation of doubtful words.</p>

<p>He was exceedingly severe in maintaining discipline
in his capacity of principal of the Academy;
he flogged one of the students&mdash;Nathan bar Assa&mdash;for
journeying on foot from the Academy to Pumbeditha
on the second day of one of the festivals.
The few years during which he retained his office
were in many ways embittered. He was stricken
by a severe illness, through which he lost his
memory, and it was consequently often necessary
for his pupils to remind him that he himself had
formerly taught them the very facts which he was
then disputing. Although they endeavored to
spare his feelings when drawing his attention to his
absurd mistakes, nevertheless, in his irritation, he
regarded these corrections as a slight, and complainingly
exclaimed: "Be indulgent with an old
man whom misfortune has caused to forget all he
learnt; and forget not that the fragments of the
first tables of the Law were preserved by the side
of the unbroken tables."</p>

<p>Joseph's hard lot may be considered as typical
of the decay of the method of teaching which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">583</a></span>
depended on the power of memory. It heaps up
the treasures of learning and tradition, guarding
every atom of its hoard as painfully as a miser, and
warns off all influences exerted by the employment
of the intellect, as if they might obscure its mirror-like
purity; but in an unlucky moment the store that
has been laboriously collected suddenly vanishes;
memory is extinguished, and there remain no means
of recovering the lost treasures.</p>

<p>The Soranian school, the home of culture, also
began to decline, through neglecting to further the
development of the Law. After Chasda's death,
the post of principal was held for twelve years
(309&ndash;320) by Huna's son, Rabba or Rab Abba;
but the studious youths were more strongly attracted
by the rising star of the Pumbedithan Academy.
For this reason Rabba's modesty is the only circumstance
in connection with which any remembrance
of him is retained. After the death of Rabba bar
Huna, the Soranian Academy was deserted, and it
was not frequented until half a century later, when
it began to regain its lost renown.</p>

<p>After Joseph's death, the college was embarrassed
as to whom it should appoint as his successor.
There were four who seemed worthy to
occupy this post, being all equally esteemed; they
were Abayi, Raba, Zeïra II, and Rabba bar Matana.
The college accordingly determined to vote for the
one who should give the most striking answer, to
which no objection could be offered, to a question
that was raised. Abayi was victorious in this
intellectual tournament, and was chosen as principal.
Abayi, whose surname was Nachmani (born about
280, died 338), was an orphan; his father Kailil had
died before, his mother immediately after, his birth.
A governess took the place of his mother, while
Rabba, the sagacious Amora of Pumbeditha, filled
that of his father. In after-life, Abayi spoke with
gratitude and emotion of his foster-mother, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">584</a></span>
gave her name to several healing medicaments.
To his uncle Rabba, Abayi owed his knowledge of
the Law and his skill in Talmudical dialectics. Like
Raba, his contemporary Amora, he aroused great
expectations during his early youth, and it used to
be said of them, "The bud shows what the melon
will be." Abayi appears to have possessed but a
moderate fortune. Like the majority of the Babylonian
teachers of the Law, however, he had a
small field of his own, which he cultivated by the
agency of a freeman. His character was mild and
yielding, and he retained these qualities in his
intercourse with the various classes of society. His
maxim was: that man should be sagacious in the
fear of God, gentle and conciliatory in his speech,
and at peace with his brethren, with his relations, in
fact, with all the world, even with the heathen
abroad, so that he might be beloved and esteemed,
and possess influence over his fellow-men. At this
time opinions, words, and deeds, were still one and
the same. Abayi's integrity was even acknowledged
by such of the Samaritans as dwelt in Babylonia.
Having once lost an ass which was found by some
Samaritans, it was brought back by them to its
owner, though he was not able to mention any
special mark by which it could be recognized. "If
thou wert not Nachmani," said they to him, "we
should not have restored the ass even if it had
borne some particular mark." Under Abayi's
direction of the Pumbedithan Academy (333&ndash;338)
the number of students diminished to about two
hundred, and therefore in remembrance of the
crowd of scholars who had flocked thither during
the time of his predecessors, Rab and Huna, he
called himself an "orphan of orphans." It was
not that less interest and pleasure than formerly
were now felt in study, but that Abayi possessed
a rival in Raba, who had founded a school of his
own in Machuza on the Tigris, whither he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">585</a></span>
attracted many students. Both of these teachers
brought the Pumbedithan method to its greatest
perfection. Rivaling one another in talent and
ingenuity, they discovered answers to questions
which Rabba and Joseph had been unable to solve.</p>

<p>The traditions which had been handed down no
longer afforded material for discussion, every
point which they presented having already been
thoroughly elucidated; new themes were therefore
propounded and solved by the help of recognized
formulæ. These subtle Talmudical dialectics received
the names of their most proficient adepts,
and were known as the "Havayot (reflections)
d'Abayi ve Raba."</p>

<p>Before his death, Abayi heard of the cruel persecutions
to which his coreligionists in Judæa were
subjected under Constantius. The fugitives who
conveyed this sad news to Babylonia, also brought
with them new Halachas, from the circle of which
Jochanan was the head, and thus inspired the
learned students of Babylonia with new vigor.</p>

<p>Abayi died in the prime of life (338). After his
death, the office of principal was conferred upon
Raba bar Joseph bar Chama of Machuza (born
299, died 352), without any discussion, as if this
was expected as a matter of course. Raba was
wealthy, talented and acute, but possessed his
weak points, which caused him to be considered
inferior to his fellow Amoraim, although he surpassed
them in acuteness of intellect. He was
well acquainted with his own character, and described
himself in the following words: "I have
always cherished three wishes, of which, while two
have been fulfilled, the gratification of the third
has not been vouchsafed to me. I desired Huna's
learning and Chasda's wealth, and obtained both;
but Rabba bar Huna's unassuming modesty was
not allotted to me." Although he was superior
to the majority of his fellow-countrymen, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">586</a></span>
character was tainted, nevertheless, with certain
peculiarities of the Machuzans; he was luxurious,
proud and overbearing, and although his fellow-countrymen
did not enjoy the best of reputations
in Babylonia, he flattered them to excess. He was
exceedingly desirous of winning and retaining their
favor. "When I became judge," he relates, "I was
afraid that I should no longer retain the attachment
of the Machuzans, but as they recognize my impartiality
in giving judgment, all must either hate or
all love me." Abayi seems to have reproved this
tendency of Raba to sacrifice moral dignity for the
acquisition of popular favor. "When a teacher of
the Law," said he, "is too greatly beloved by his
fellow-citizens, it is not because of his great merit,
but on account of his indulgence, which causes him to
refrain from calling attention to their vices, and
from earnestly reprimanding them."</p>

<p>It has already been mentioned that the inhabitants
of Machuza were descended for the most part
from proselytes, for which reason the aristocratic
Babylonian Jews forbore to contract marriages with
them. As the Machuzans thus seemed to be at a
loss how to obtain wives, Zeïra II declared in a
public discourse that it was allowable for them to
marry persons who had been born out of wedlock.
This permission, however, implying as it did a sort
of degradation of the Machuzans, was so offensive
to their pride, that they almost stoned him to death
with the fruits with which the booths were decorated
(the incident occurring during the celebration of the
feast of Tabernacles), just as King Alexander Jannæus
had once been attacked in the outer court of
the temple. Raba could hardly find words severe
enough with which to blame Zeïra's candor: "Who
would give utterance to so inconsiderate a decision
in a community containing so many descendants of
proselytes!" In order to enlist the favor of the
populace still more strongly on his side, he demonstrated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">587</a></span>
in opposition to Zeïra's theory, that proselytes
might marry even the daughters of priests,
and he succeeded by this flattery in charming the
Machuzans so greatly that they overwhelmed him
with presents of silken stuffs. In after-times Raba
attempted to restrict the equality which he had
accorded somewhat too freely to the proselytes, probably
on account of its having caused displeasure in
various circles; at the same time he remarked that
proselytes might ally themselves with bastard
families. This decision having caused dissatisfaction,
Raba appeased his fellow-countrymen with the
following words: "I only meant well towards you,
and leave you free to act either way."</p>

<p>Another of Raba's failings was that, although
exceedingly wealthy, he was not entirely free from
covetousness, which he allowed to become apparent
on several occasions. A proselyte of Machuza,
Issor by name, had deposited with Raba a sum of
12,000 sus (denars), in order to bequeath it to his
son, who was being brought up as a student of the
Law. Issor having fallen ill, Raba resolved to keep
possession of this money as property to which there
was no heir, a proselyte being unable to leave his
fortune to a son born before his adoption of Judaism,
as the Talmudical law does not recognize such offspring
as a son. At all events, the principal of the
schools&mdash;familiar as he was with all the intricacies
of the Law&mdash;was determined to nullify Issor's disposal
of his fortune in favor of his son. Meanwhile,
another person who was equally well acquainted
with the Law, suggested to the anxious father that,
although he was prevented from making over the
money in question to his son by will, he was, nevertheless,
at liberty to do so by declaring before witnesses
that the money belonged to the latter. Raba
was greatly incensed at the man who offered this
counsel, and complained as bitterly of this secret
advice as if he had thereby been deprived of a lawfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">588</a></span>
acquired fortune. Raba's conduct also violated
an accepted Halacha which treats of a similar case.
According to this law, although a man is not obliged
to hand over to such of the sons as may have
become proselytes, the property committed to his
keeping by a heathen, of which the latter had
not otherwise disposed, an offense is, nevertheless,
committed against the higher laws of morality by
withholding it from them.</p>

<p>Another example of Raba's selfish conduct is
afforded by the fact that he exacted a higher rent
from the tenants of his fields than was customary in
Babylonia. At times his behavior towards persons
of slender means was marked by a harshness which
was in glaring opposition to the doctrines of charity
and pity, inculcated equally by the Halachas and the
Scriptures.</p>

<p>The conduct of his brother Saurim was even
more heartless; he posed as a moral censor, and
whenever any of the poorer members of the community
appeared to him not to be religious enough
he made slaves of them, and compelled them to
carry him about in his gilded litter. Even to this
conduct Raba offered no objection, but sanctioned
his brother's arbitrary proceedings by referring to
a long-forgotten law, which countenanced the treatment
of the Jews as slaves, in case they no longer
lived in accordance with the Law.</p>

<p>During this period the simple manners and the
honesty which had obtained among the Jews of
Babylonia in former times, fell to a low ebb with
many of them, and made room for luxury, vanity,
and thirst for power. Many a teacher of the Law was
clad in gorgeous garments and was carried about in
a gilded litter. They no longer felt themselves one
with the people from whom they had risen, but
constituted a particular caste, a patrician class, who
mutually protected and maintained one another's
interests, looking down with pride and contempt on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">589</a></span>
the lower orders of the populace. Raba himself
admitted that whenever he was called upon to
decide a point of law in which a person of the same
class of society as himself was concerned, he was
unable to sleep until he succeeded in interpreting
the law in his favor. If a member of the school
brought his produce to market, he was invested
with the privilege of being allowed to sell before
any one else, in order that he might obtain higher
prices. The cause of a member was always heard
first in the court. The teachers of the Law of such
communities as paid their taxes in a lump sum,
were exempt from all imposts. Raba allowed the
associates, in places where they were not known,
to declare their rank, in order that they might enjoy
the advantages attaching thereto. What a contrast
to former times, when the Tanaites hesitated, at
the risk of their lives even, to derive any benefit
from their knowledge of the Law! Raba went to
extreme lengths in according privileges to the
doctors of the Law. He permitted the associates
to pass themselves off as worshipers of fire in order
to escape payment of the <i xml:lang="he" lang="he">charag</i>.</p>

<p>The course of conduct thus pursued by the learned
classes gradually awoke a dislike of them among
the people. The lower classes spoke of them contemptuously
as "those scholars." The mockery
expressed by this epithet must have been so bitter
that on their side the teachers of the Law branded
as heretics (Epicureans) all who made use of the
expression. Scholarship thus no longer obtained
recognition. "What do we profit by the scholars?"
the people asked themselves; "all their knowledge
is employed for their own benefit." At the head of
this opposition to the Rabbis stood the family of the
physician, Benjamin of Machuza, which seems to
have been possessed of great importance, as Raba
paid great attention to its members. "What advantage
do we really derive from the teachers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">590</a></span>
the Law?" said they jeeringly; "they can neither
allow us to eat ravens, nor forbid us to eat pigeons?"&mdash;meaning
that in spite of all their dialectics they were
unable to proceed beyond the circle of established
customs. Although Raba declared this utterance
of Benjamin Assia to be heretical, it does not
appear that he excommunicated him, but rather that
he treated him with great consideration; it is probable
that the latter belonged to the retinue of the
Prince of the Captivity.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the zeal for the study of the Law
had greatly increased. Disciples crowded in even
greater numbers than formerly to Raba's academy
in Machuza, neglecting in their ardor their business
pursuits. Raba was obliged to warn them against
this excess: "I pray you do not come to my school
in the spring and autumn months, lest you should
neglect the time of the harvest and of the preparation
of wine and oil, and so be troubled throughout
the year by the cares of life." Raba's discourses
were even more popular than Abayi's by reason of
the clearness of his explanations, the exactitude of
his distinctions, and the boldness of his treatment
of the subject-matter of tradition. Raba showed a
decided preference for analyzing the Mishna to the
bare study of its dry subject-matter. The former
method offered a wide field for the employment of
dialectical powers, while the Mishna, taken in its
simplest sense, became a mere matter of memory.
On this account Raba placed the Amoraïm above
the Tanaites; the former explained, or explained
better, such points as were doubtful to the latter.
He was accustomed to say that a grain of pepper
(acuteness) was better than a basketful of melons.
In contrast to Zeïra I, who was adverse to that method
of teaching which encouraged ingenious reasoning,
and valued highly the simplicity of the Mishna, Raba
declared that "whoso breaketh stones injureth himself
thereby (Eccles. x. 9); thus are they characterized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">591</a></span>
who know merely the Mishna; but he who
splitteth wood warmeth himself; such are they who
are acquainted with the Talmud." The true Talmud,
the attractive collection of nice questions, answers,
comparisons and distinctions, the lofty flight of
thought, which, starting from a point, passes with
the quickness of lightning over the intermediate
steps of a chain of reasoning, the dialectic form of
the Talmud is the product of this period. The
triumvirate, Rabba, Abayi, and Raba, were Talmudists
in the real meaning of the word, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">i. e.</i>, dialecticians.
In this sense the Talmud was the creation
of the Pumbedithan and Machuzan schools. In
Judæa there was scarcely a notion of it. By reason
of his extensive acquirements, his profound intellect,
and perhaps also on account of his wealth, Raba
remained the sole authority during his continuance
at the head of the academy. Questions were referred
to him even from Judæa, when the frequent
persecutions under Constantius and Gallus involved
the Holy Land in the deepest misery.</p>

<p>This period was by no means the happiest for the
Jewish subjects of the Persian crown; they were
not spared during the obstinate struggle between
Rome and Persia. A Persian army was stationed
at Machuza, and had to be maintained by the
inhabitants of the town. As the population was
entirely Jewish, this duty was attended with many
inconveniences. Shabur II was no friend of the
Jews. In ancient times numerous Jewish families
had been transported to Armenia, and now lived
there in their own cities; of these, Shabur led an
immense multitude (estimated at 71,000) into captivity,
and colonized them in Susiana and Ispahan.
This latter city, which had formerly been the capital
of the Persian empire, received the name of Jehudia,
from the many Jews who settled there after the
captivity. Shabur appears to have oppressed the
Jews of Babylonia in no less degree, for Raba was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">592</a></span>
obliged to expend considerable sums of money in
preventing persecution. His friends extolled his
good luck in being, to a certain extent, exempted
from the misfortunes to which the Jewish people
had been predestined, seeing that up till then he
had been subjected to no extortions. To these
congratulations Raba replied as follows: "You
know not how much I am obliged to do in secret
for Shabur's court!" On one occasion it was with
great difficulty that he managed to escape a personal
danger which threatened him in his capacity
of principal of the schools. He had ordered a Jew
to be flogged for having held carnal intercourse with
a Persian woman, and the chastisement had caused
the death of the culprit. The case happening to
come to Shabur's knowledge, he commanded a heavy
punishment to be inflicted on Raba for having exercised
the criminal jurisdiction. The latter appears
to have escaped the penalty by flight, but his house
was pillaged. All further consequences of this
occurrence were averted by Ifra, the queen-mother,
who is reported to have said to her son: "Do not
meddle in any way with the Jews, for God grants
them whatever they pray for." In striking contrast
with her son, Ifra-Ormuzd entertained a special liking
for the Jews, and in particular for the teachers of the
Law, to whom at times she vouchsafed a glance into
the most secret recesses of her heart. In the same
way as she had formerly sent a purse of gold to
Joseph, she now forwarded 400 golden denars to
Raba. Rami, a contemporary, was of opinion that
this present ought to be refused, as it was not
lawful to receive alms of the heathens. Notwithstanding
this, Raba accepted the money, but distributed
it amongst the heathen poor. The queen-mother
Ifra also sent an animal for sacrifice to the
principal of the school in Machuza, which she
requested might be offered up according to the
Jewish rites, in order to prove her adoration of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">593</a></span>
only God. Raba did not live to see either the
introduction of the calendar by Hillel, or the short
period during which prosperity smiled upon the
Jews. He died after holding his office for fourteen
years.</p>

<p>After Raba's death the importance of Machuza
began to decline, and Pumbeditha, which had
unwillingly surrendered the palm to Raba, now
occupied its former position. It is remarkable that
from this time forward mediocrity began to reign,
as if intellectual activity needed recreation after so
many exertions. Not one of Raba's successors
was sufficiently able to compensate for his loss.
The principals of the Babylonian schools, Nachman
ben Isaac, Papa, and Chama of Nahardea, were
possessed of no conspicuous importance; the
Pumbedithan spirit of severe analysis and ingenious
dialectics was indeed cultivated, but in nowise
advanced.</p>

<p>Nachman ben Isaac (born about 280, died 356)
was chosen as the leader of the Pumbedithan Metibta,
but merely on account of his advanced age, his
extraordinary piety, and perhaps also of his independence.
His tenure of office only extended over
four years, and was not rendered memorable by
any noteworthy feature. During this period a new
academy was founded at Nares, in proximity to
Sora, situated on the canal of the same name.</p>

<p>The founder of this new academy, of which he
became the principal, was Papa bar Chanan (born
about 300, died 375). He had early been left an
orphan, was wealthy, and by trade a brewer of beer
from dates. His friend, Huna ben Joshua, equally
wealthy, and his partner in business, became a
teacher at this academy. But the two together
were not able to fill the void which Raba's death
had occasioned. It is true that the members of
the Machuzan academy gathered around them; but
opportunities soon arose of effecting comparisons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">594</a></span>
the results of which were anything but favorable to
the new chiefs.</p>

<p>The following anecdote will serve to indicate the
character of the principal of the Nares academy.
Certain of the younger teachers of the Law had
come to Nares in order to be present at Papa's
lectures. This latter, however, left his subject in
so confused a condition, that they secretly began to
make signs one to the other. Papa, seeing this,
was exceedingly mortified, and said to them: "Let
those present depart from here in peace." Another
member, one Simaï bar Ashi (father of the Ashi
who became famous later on), used to importune
Papa with questions which quite exceeded his
modest capabilities. Papa, in despair lest he should
be put to shame before his pupils, would throw
himself down in prayer, and beseech the merciful
God to preserve him from the terrible feeling of
confusion. Simaï, having been an unobserved
witness of this fervent prayer, made up his mind
that henceforward he would keep silence, and no
longer involuntarily mortify Papa.</p>

<p>In the Halacha, Papa was the representative of a
school which was so devoid of self-dependence,
that its partisans did not even hold an opinion of
their own concerning the views of others. Whenever
two or more conflicting opinions left the meaning
of a precept of the Law in doubt, Papa would say:
"Let us adopt both views, or act according to all
these opinions." Papa remained at his post during
nineteen years (355&ndash;375), and the stupor into which
all minds were thrown during this period was only
dissipated by his successor. Pumbeditha possessed
a principal of equal insignificance in Chama of
Nahardea, whose character a single anecdote will
suffice to indicate. King Shabur asked him whether
the practice of burying the dead was founded on
the Torah, or whether it was simply an ancient
custom. The question arose from the usage of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">595</a></span>
Persians, who neither buried nor burned the corpses
of their dead. Chama, however, could bring forward
no passage of Scripture in support of burial. Acha
ben Jacob, a member of the household of the Prince
of the Captivity, and therefore privileged to say
many things, expressed the following opinion of
this principal: "The world is delivered into the
hands of fools; why did he not instance the verse,
'And thou shalt bury him on the same day'?"</p>

<p>In the course of the twenty-one years (356&ndash;377)
during which Chama held office, a change occurred
in the Roman Empire which was not without
weighty consequences for the communities of Judæa
and Babylonia. A nephew of the Emperor Constantius,
Julian, effected a revolution which, however,
was only temporary. Emperor Julian was one of
those masterful characters who impress their names
indelibly on the memory of man. It was only an
early death and the hatred of the ruling Church
which prevented him from obtaining the title of
"Great." Although a member of Constantine's
family, the fratricidal sword of the Constantines
hung over his head, and he was compelled by
fear of death to give hypocritical adhesion to the
Christian religion, which he hated. Almost by a
miracle he was created co-emperor by his uncle
Constantius, who hated him from the bottom of his
heart, and had already held a council about his
death. A military revolt in his favor, and the
unexpected death of his enemy Constantius, put
Julian in possession of exclusive power. Known in
the history of the Church as the Apostate (Apostata,
Parabata), Julian made it the duty of his life to
realize the ideal, which association with his teachers,
Libanius and Maximus, had suggested to him, and
which had been further ennobled by his rich mind.
His favorite thoughts were to protect the oppressed
of all nations and religions, to promote the well-being
of all his subjects, more especially by alleviating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">596</a></span>
the burden of taxes, to revive the philosophical
sciences, which had been condemned by
the Christian emperors, to restore the ancient
religion, freed, however, from its most conspicuous
blemishes, which had rendered it so contemptible
and ridiculous; finally, to confine Christianity, which
had gained so much power during so short a period,
within its proper limits. Mindful, however, of the
persecution to which he himself had been subjected,
he refrained from retaliating on the Christians, in
spite of their mania for persecution. Still, he was
desirous of restraining their encroachments, and
therefore deprived them of their influence in civil
and scientific matters, and attempted to lower them
in the appreciation of the learned classes by the
employment of the weapons of the intellect and
delicate satire. He called Jesus a Galilæan whom
credulity had exalted to a god, and spoke of the
Christians by the nickname of Galilæans. For
this reason he was all the more friendly toward the
Jews, and was the only emperor after Alexander
Severus who evinced serious interest in Judaism.
He was led by more reasons than one to prefer
Judaism. Brought up in the Christian religion, he
had become acquainted with Judaism through the
Holy Bible, and the more Judaism was hated and
persecuted by Christianity, the greater was the
reverence with which he regarded it. The emperor
even admitted that he had been greatly shocked
by the cruel oppression to which the Jews were
exposed during the reign of Constantius, when
their religion was branded as blasphemous by
victorious Christianity. Julian was greatly impressed
by the God of Judaism, as described in
Holy Writ, and acknowledged him as the "Great
God." He refused to believe, however, that beside
Him there existed no other gods. He especially
admired the benevolence of the Jews, and was
astonished that they cared for their poor with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">597</a></span>
such zeal that no beggars existed among them.
He was also desirous of deeply mortifying the
Christians by the preference which he exhibited for
the Jews, for the former were at great pains to
prove the superiority of their religion by the abasement
of the latter. He entertained a particular
predilection for the sacrificial cult, and for this
reason he was especially pleased with the Jewish
system of sacrifices, with the solemn pomp of the
Temple and the priests. The emperor reproached
the Christians with having rejected the God and
the worship of Judaism, but he particularly blamed
them for having discarded the sacrificial service.
It was true that the Jews did not then offer sacrifices,
but this was only because they no longer possessed
a Temple. Finally, the idea may have occurred to
Julian to dispose the Babylonian Jews in his favor
for the Persian war which now occupied his whole
attention. He desired, if not to obtain their active
support, at least to prevent them from offering
fanatical resistance.</p>

<p>Julian's reign, which lasted not quite two years
(November, 361 to June, 363) was a period of extreme
happiness for the Jews of the Roman Empire.
The emperor favored them, relieving them from
oppression, and from the disgrace which the taunt
of blasphemy entailed. He called the Patriarch
Hillel his venerable friend, and honored him with
an autograph letter, wherein he assured him of his
good-will, and promised to try and put an end to
the wrongs of the Jews. He also addressed an
epistle to all the Jewish communities of the empire,
and made preparations for rebuilding the Temple
in Jerusalem, which had become a Christian city
since the time of Constantine. The imperial missive,
which stands out in glaring contrast with the
course of treatment adopted by the first two Christian
emperors, is remarkable enough to merit being
preserved. The letter (written at Antioch in the
autumn of 362 or the winter of 363) ran as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">598</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">To the Jewish Congregations.</span>&mdash;More oppressive for you in
the past than the yoke of dependence was the circumstance that
new taxes were imposed upon you without previous notice, and you
were thus compelled to furnish an immense quantity of gold to the
imperial treasury. I learnt much by personal observation, but still
more by the tax-rolls which were being preserved to your detriment,
and which I happened to light upon. I myself abolished a tax which
it was intended to impose upon you, and thus put a stop to the
injustice of attempting to cast such a slur on you; with my own
hands did I commit to the flames the tax-rolls against you which I
came across in my archives, in order that for the future no one might
spread such a charge of blasphemy against you. My brother Constantius,
the Glorious, was not so much to blame for this as those
barbarians in thought and godless in spirit who invented such a
system of taxation. With my own arm have I hurled them to deepest
ruin, so that not even the memory of their fall shall remain with us.
Being on the point of according you yet greater favor, I have exhorted
my brother, the venerable Patriarch Julos (Hillel), to put a
stop to the collection of the so-called Apostole from you, and henceforward
let no one further oppress your nation with the collection of
such imposts, so that everywhere in my empire you may be free from
care; and thus, in the full enjoyment of peace, may you address your
fervent prayers for my empire to the Almighty Creator of the Universe,
who has supported me with His strong right hand. It seems to be
the fact, that those whose lives are passed in anxiety are indolent
of spirit, and do not dare raise their hands in supplication for the
prosperity of their country. But those who are exempt from all care,
and are glad with their whole hearts, are able to direct their sincere
prayers for the welfare of the empire to the Most High, who can best
further my rule as I propose to reign. Thus should you do in order
that, on the happy termination of the Persian war, I may be able to
visit Jerusalem, the Holy City, which shall be rebuilt at my expense,
as you have desired to see it restored for so many years: then will I
unite with you in giving praise to the Almighty."</p></blockquote>

<p>It is not related what impression was produced
by this gracious letter, which, more winning even
than Cyrus' missive to the Babylonian exiles, came
as a drop of refreshing dew after long drought.
A single account, which is borrowed from Jewish
tradition, relates that the Jews applied to Julian the
following verse (Daniel xi. 34): "Now when they
shall fall, they shall be holpen with a little help."
Daniel is thus supposed to have prophesied that
after the Jewish nation had suffered at the hands of
Gallus, Julian would extend help to them by his
support and his promise to rebuild the Temple.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Julian did not forget to act upon his
promise. Although abundantly occupied with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">599</a></span>
preparations for the Persian war, he had nevertheless
at heart the restoration of the Temple of Jerusalem
from its ruins. For this purpose he appointed
a special chief overseer in the person of his best
friend, the learned and virtuous Alypius of Antioch,
and exhorted him to spare no expense during the
rebuilding. The governors of Syria and Palestine
received orders to aid Alypius with everything that
was necessary. The building materials were already
prepared, and workmen were assembled in great
numbers for the purpose of clearing away the ruins
which had lain heaped upon the site of the Temple
ever since its destruction, nearly three hundred
years before. The Jews do not seem to have interested
themselves in the rebuilding of the Temple,
for the Jewish authorities maintain a complete
silence concerning this fact, and the stories of the
ardor of the Jews for the rebuilding which are
related by the later Christian reports are purely
fictitious. The distant communities are said to have
forwarded sums of money toward the restoration of
the Temple, and it is even asserted that women
sold their jewelry and brought stones in their laps.
But all this was quite unnecessary, for Julian had
amply provided both building materials and workmen.
The Christians also spread the report that
Julian only pretended to be kindly disposed towards
the Jews in order to entice them into heathenism.
Especially spiteful is the story that the Jews destroyed
several churches in Judæa and the neighboring
countries, and threatened to inflict as much
evil on the Christians as they themselves had suffered
at the hands of the Christian emperors. The report
that about this period the Christians of Edessa
massacred the entire Jewish population of that city
is more credible. It may be assumed as a certainty
that the hope of re-establishing their state, which
had occasioned two or three revolutions, and had
cost so many victims, was extinguished in the hearts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">600</a></span>
of the Jews. The restoration of their former magnificence
was now only expected at the appearance
of the Messiah. Without the latter a Temple
would have seemed utterly absurd, according to the
views which were entertained at this period, and
still less would it have been possible for a Roman
emperor to be regarded as the Messiah. The
opinion was generally accepted that "God had
bound the Jewish nation by oath not to climb over
the wall (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">i. e.</i>, re-establish the State by force), nor to
rebel against the ruling nations, but to bear their
yoke patiently until the coming of the Messiah, and
not to attempt to bring about that period by
violence."</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Christians looked with envious
eyes upon the commencement of the work (spring,
363). The indifference of the Jews seems, however,
to have contributed more than anything else to the
suspension of the rebuilding, on account of the
various obstacles which were encountered. On the
occasion of the pulling down of the ruins, and the
excavation of the foundations, a fire broke out by
which several workmen lost their lives. This subterranean
conflagration doubtless occurred in the
passages which had formerly existed beneath the
Temple, and had its origin in the gases which had
long been compressed there, and which, on being
suddenly released from pressure, ignited on coming
into contact with the air above. These sudden explosions
occurred repeatedly, and disheartened the
workmen, so that they gradually gave up work.
If the Jews had interested themselves more warmly
in the rebuilding, it is hardly probable that they
would have allowed themselves to be discouraged
by such an obstacle, which was anything but
invincible; ardent enthusiasm shuns no sacrifice.
But deprived of the warm participation of the Jews,
Alypius also became less enthusiastic, and waited
for further commands from the emperor. Julian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">601</a></span>
however, is said to have accused the Christians of
having caused the fires to break out in the underground
passages, and to have threatened to build
a prison for Christians out of the ruins of the
Temple on his return from the war. But this story,
which, like most of those relating to this event, is
drawn from Christian sources, is utterly untrustworthy.
The Christian authorities of the following
generation relate the most wonderful tales of the
miracles which are said to have happened during
this impious rebuilding, the purpose of all of
which was to warn the obdurate Jews and to glorify
Christ.</p>

<p>The issue of the Persian war&mdash;unhappy as it was
for Julian&mdash;was also calculated to deprive the Jews
of their short-lived exultation, and to prepare a new
triumph for the Christians. Julian had concentrated
the whole of the Roman forces, and had availed
himself of every possible expedient in order not to
be inferior in strength to his opponent, Shabur II.
Shabur on his side had set himself the task of freeing
Asia from the Roman rule. Julian, however, was
dreaming the golden dream which had lured many
a Roman general, from Crassus and Cæsar downwards,
to the region of the Euphrates. His ambition
was to plant the Roman eagle on the further side
of the Tigris.</p>

<p>Once again Europe and Asia stood face to face.
The scene of the war was laid, for the most part, in
the province of Jewish Babylonia. It is impossible
to determine which side was espoused by the Jews.
The town of Firuz-Shabur, which contained many
Jewish inhabitants, was obstinately besieged for
three days, compelled to capitulate, and finally
burnt. The inhabitants escaped in small boats by
the canals of the Euphrates. The conduct of the
Jewish inhabitants of Firuz-Shabur towards Julian
therefore remains uncertain. But the town of Bitra
(more correctly Birtha), which was inhabited entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">602</a></span>
by Jews, and was surrounded by a low wall, displayed
a spirit of hostility; it was completely abandoned
by its population, and the soldiers, giving vent to
their martial passion, burnt it to the ground. The
town of Machuza (Maoga-Malka), which was to
a certain extent a suburb of Ctesiphon, was held by
a Persian garrison; it was most hotly besieged, and
offered so determined a resistance that the entire
military force of the Romans hardly sufficed
to effect its fall. Machuza, the seat of Raba's
academy, whose proud Jewish inhabitants rivaled
those of the capital in magnificence, fell ten years
after Raba's death (363) under the blows of the
Roman catapults, and became a heap of ruins.
After the war it was again rebuilt. In spite of the
progress which Julian made into the enemy's
country, he did not succeed in reaching Ctesiphon.
He lost not only the fruits of his victories, but even
his life, through his rashness. He was struck down
by an arrow, said to have been shot by a Christian
belonging to his own army. Calmly, and as becomes
a philosopher, Julian breathed his last. It is related
that a few minutes before his death he exclaimed:
"Thou hast conquered, O Galilæan!"</p>

<p>The death of Julian in the neighborhood of the
Tigris (June, 363) deprived the Jews of the last ray
of hope for a peaceful and unmolested existence.
His favor was, however, so far attended with good
effect, that the edicts promulgated against the Jews
by Constantine and Constantius were not immediately
renewed; Julian's ordinances remained
in force in so far as they did not affect the privileges
of the Jews. Jovianus, Julian's successor (June, 363
to February, 364), was compelled to conclude an
ignominious peace with the victorious Shabur; he
lived too short a time to be able to effect any
changes. He permitted his subjects to freely declare
their adherence to any religion they chose, without
thereby incurring any disadvantage. Once again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">603</a></span>
the Roman empire was divided between two rulers,
Valentinian I (364&ndash;375), and Valens (364&ndash;378). The
latter, who was Emperor of the East, was an Arian,
and had suffered too severely from the powerful
Catholic party to be intolerant himself. He protected
the Jews and bestowed honors and distinctions
upon them. His brother, Valentinian I, the
Emperor of the West, likewise chose the policy of
tolerance in the struggle between Catholics and
Arians, and permitted the profession of either religion
without political disadvantages being thereby
incurred (371). This toleration was also extended
the Jews.</p>

<p>The period during which the Roman empire was
approaching a state of complete dissolution marks
an epoch of decay and regeneration, destruction
and rejuvenescence, ruin and reconstruction, in the
history of the world. The storm, which burst in the
north, under the wall of China, brought down a
black thunder-cloud in its train, and shattered the
giant tree of the Roman empire, which, sapless and
leafless, had only continued to exist thus far by the
force of gravity; nothing now remained but a wreck
of splinters, the toy of every capricious wind. The
uncouth Huns, the scourge of God, drove before
them horde upon horde, tribe upon tribe, whose
names the memory refuses to retain or the tongue
to utter. The period of the migration of the nations
confirms almost literally the words of the prophet:
"The earth staggers like a drunken man, and her
sins lie heavy upon her; she falls and cannot rise,
and the Lord Zebaoth punishes the bands of heaven
in heaven, and the kings of earth upon earth."
Small wonder indeed that in the Goths, the first
wave of the migration of tribes which inundated
and devastated the Roman empire, the Jews did not
fail to discover Gog from the land of Magog, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">605</a></span>
whom a prophet had said: "Thou shalt ascend and
come like a storm, thou shalt be like a cloud to
cover the land, thou and all thy bands, and many
people with thee" (Ezekiel xxxviii. 9).</p>

<p>In this remarkable alternation of disappearance
of nations and their formation, the conviction forced
itself upon Jewish thinkers that the Jewish people
was eternal: "A nation arises, another vanishes, but
Israel alone remains forever." The barbaric tribes,
the avengers of the long-enslaved nations, settled
on the ruined sites of the Roman empire, wild
plants only to be cultivated by the master-hand of
history, uncouth savages, to be civilized by earnest
teaching. In this iron time, when no man could be
certain of the next day, the leaders of Judaism in
Palestine and Babylonia felt deeply the necessity of
placing the treasure which had been confided to
their hands in safety, so that it might not be imperiled
by the accidents of the day. An epoch of
collection commenced, during which the harvest which
had been sown, cultivated, and reaped by their forefathers
was brought under shelter. The subject-matter
of tradition, which had been so greatly
augmented, enriched and purified by a long series
of generations and the diversity of schools, was
henceforward to be set in order. This tendency of
compilation and arrangement was represented by
Ashi.</p>

<p>Rabbana Ashi (born 352, died 427) was the son
of Simaï, and the descendant of an ancient family.
He so early gave evidence of complete maturity of
mind, that while still a youth he restored the long-desolate
Soranian academy to its former place of
honor. He was certainly not more than twenty
when he became principal of that school. Coming
of a wealthy family, Ashi possessed many forests,
the wood of which he had no compunction in selling
to feed the holy fire for the worship of the Magi.
It is remarkable that nothing is known of the history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">606</a></span>
of his youth and education; there is even no indication
of the reason which induced him to infuse
new life into the half-decayed Soranian academy;
probably Sora was his native town. He pulled
down and rebuilt the school which had been erected
several centuries previously by Rab, and which was
already beginning to exhibit signs of decay; and in
order that no delay should occur in the rebuilding,
he brought his bed on the site, and remained
there night and day until the gutters of the house
had been put up. The Sora school was built on an
elevation so that it might overlook the whole city.
Ashi's splendid qualities so impressed his contemporaries
that he was regarded as the supreme authority,
a position to which no person had been able to
attain since Raba's death. Ashi united thorough
knowledge of the entire body of the Law, characteristic
of Sora, with Pumbedithan dialectics, and
thus satisfied all claims. His contemporaries conferred
upon him the distinguishing title of Rabbana
(our teacher). During the fifty-two years over
which his public labors extended, seven principals
succeeded each other in Pumbeditha. Nahardea,
which had made no figure since its destruction by
Ben-Nazar (Odenath), also began to come into some
repute again on account of the academy opened
there by Amemar (390&ndash;420). But none of these
teachers really disputed the supremacy with Ashi,
and Sora again occupied the honorable position into
which it had been placed by Rab. The oldest
Amoraim, Amemar and Mar-Zutra, voluntarily
subordinated themselves to Ashi's authority, and
resigned to him the task of restoring unity. The
most distinguished among them, even the two successive
Princes of the Captivity of this period (Mar-Kahana
and Mar-Zutra I), submitted to his orders.
It was in Sora that the Princes of the Captivity now
received the homage of the delegates of all the
Babylonian communities; this ceremony had formerly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">607</a></span>
taken place, first at Nahardea, and then,
during the prime of its academy, at Pumbeditha.
This homage was paid every year on a Sabbath, at
the commencement of the month of Marcheshvan
(in the autumn), and this Sabbath was known as
the "Rigle" of the Prince of the Captivity. The
extraordinary assemblies of the people, which met
at the command of the Prince of the Captivity, were
henceforward also held in Sora, and for this reason
the Patriarchs were obliged to repair to that town,
even though they had fixed their residence in some
other place. Ashi had thus made Sora the center
of Jewish life in Babylonia, and had connected it
with everything of public or general interest. The
splendor with which its numerous assemblies invested
it, was so great that Ashi expressed surprise
that the heathen Persians could be witnesses of it
all, and not feel themselves moved to embrace
Judaism.</p>

<p>In consequence of this concentration of power in
his own person, Ashi was enabled to undertake a
work, the consequences of which were incalculable,
both as regards the fate and the development of
the Jewish people. He began the gigantic task of
collecting and arranging the explanations, deductions,
and amplifications of the Mishna, which were
included under the name "Talmud." The immediate
motive which suggested this undertaking was
undoubtedly the consideration that the immense
accumulation of matter, the result of the labor of
three generations, ought not to be allowed to vanish
from memory through lack of interest. This would
certainly be the case if some means were not provided
of impressing it easily upon the mind. Ashi
even then complained of the diminution of the
power of memory in his time as compared with
times gone by, without, however, taking into account
that by reason of the accumulation of matter the
memory was infinitely more charged than formerly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">608</a></span>
His successful treatment of this exuberant material
was rendered the easier by the fact that he was
permitted to work at it for more than half a century.
Every year on the occasion of the assembly of all
the members, disciples, and pupils during the Kalla
months, certain tractates of the Mishna, together
with the Talmudical explanations and corollaries,
were thoroughly gone into, and thus in about thirty
years more than fifty of them were completely
arranged. In the latter half of his period of office
Ashi went through the whole of the matter which
had thus been put in order for the second time.
What remained after this double process of winnowing
and testing was accepted as of binding
force.</p>

<p>This arrangement of the bulky matter of the
Talmud was not committed to writing. The conservation
in writing of oral tradition, the incarnation,
as it were, of what is spiritual, was still regarded as a
crime against religion, more especially at this period,
when Christendom had taken possession of the
Holy Scriptures as its own spiritual property, and
considered itself as the chosen part of Israel. According
to the views of the times, Judaism was
now possessed of no distinguishing feature, except
the Oral Law. This thought frequently found
expression in a poetical form&mdash;"Moses requested
permission to commit to writing the Mishna or Oral
Law, but God saw in advance that the nations
would one day possess a Greek translation of the
Torah, and would affirm: 'We are Israel; we are
the children of God,' while the Jewish people would
also declare, 'We are God's children,' and He
therefore gave a token for this purpose: 'He who
possesses my secret (mysterion) is my son.' This
secret is the Mishna and the oral exegesis of the
Law. Therefore did the prophet Hosea say:
'Were I to write the fulness of the Law, Israel
would be accounted as a stranger.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">609</a></span>
It is not at all astonishing that this multitude of
ordered details could be retained by the memory,
for before the time of Ashi they had been retained
though not yet reduced to order. By his compilation
of the Talmud, Ashi completed the work which had
been begun by Judah two centuries previously.
But his task was infinitely more difficult. The
Mishna embraced only the plain Halacha in artistically
constructed paragraphs of the Law. The
Talmud, however, gave also the living part of the
development of the Law and its spiritual tenor,
and this with dialectic exactitude. The first impulse
to the compilation of the Talmud marks one of the
most important epochs in Jewish history. From
this time forward the Babylonian Talmud (Talmud
Babli) became an active, potent, and influential
element. Ashi, however, did not entirely complete
this gigantic task; for, although he directed his
ardor wholly to the work of compilation, the creative
power was not so completely conquered either in
him or his contemporaries, that they were content
to entirely restrict their energies to the work of
compilation. On the contrary, Ashi solved many
of the questions which had been left doubtful, or
had been unsatisfactorily answered by the preceding
Amoraïm, and his decisions are as forcible
and ingenious as they are simple; in fact, one often
wonders how they could have been overlooked by
his predecessors. About this time the Jerusalem or
Palestinean Talmud was compiled and concluded.
The name of the compiler is not known. The
latest authorities whose names have been preserved
are Samuel bar Bun and Jochanan bar Moryah,
contemporaries of Ashi.</p>

<p>The period of Ashi's activity falls within the
reign of Jezdijird (400&ndash;420), a king of the Sassanian
dynasty, who was favorably disposed towards the
Jews. The Magians gave to this noble prince the
surname of "Al Hatim" (the sinner), because he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">610</a></span>
refused to surrender his own will and allow himself
to be ruled by them. He was exceedingly well
affected towards the Jews, and at the same time
favorably disposed towards the Christians. On the
days of homage there were present at his court the
three representatives of the Babylonian Jews:
Ashi, of Sora; Mar-Zutra, of Pumbeditha; and
Amemar, of Nahardea. Huna bar Nathan, who, if
he was no Prince of the Captivity, must nevertheless
have been possessed of considerable influence, held
frequent intercourse with Jezdijird's court. This
mark of attention on the part of a Persian king, who
proclaimed himself the child of the Sun, a worshiper
of Ormuz, and the King of the Kings of Iran, may
be regarded as a proof of high favor.</p>

<p>Ashi was devoid of all exaggerated enthusiasm,
and seems to have attempted to suppress the
hope of the coming of the Messiah, which kept
the minds of the Jews in greater suspense than
ever at this time of the migration of nations and
of universal revolution, when sin-laden Rome was
suffering the punishment of God. An ancient
sibylline saying, attributed to the prophet Elijah,
was current, according to which the Messiah would
appear in the eighty-fifth jubilee (between 440 and
470 of the common era). Such messianic expectations
were always certain of creating enthusiasts,
who aimed at converting their silent belief into fact,
and without exactly intending to deceive, attempted
to carry away such of the crowd as were of like
opinions, and to excite them to such a pitch that
they would willingly sacrifice their lives. In point
of fact such an enthusiast did appear during Ashi's
time in Crete, and he gained as adherents all the
Jewish congregations of this important island,
through which he had traveled in a year. He
promised them that one day he would lead them dry-footed,
as Moses had formerly done, through the sea
into the promised land; he is said to have adopted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611">611</a></span>
the name of the great lawgiver. For the rest, this
Cretan Moses was able to convince his followers so
thoroughly of his divine mission, that they neglected
their business, abandoned all their property, and
only waited for the day of the passage through the
sea. On the appointed day, Moses the Messiah
marched in front, and behind him came the entire
Jewish population of Crete, including the women
and the children. From a promontory projecting
out into the sea, he commanded them to throw themselves
fearlessly into the ocean, as the waters would
divide themselves before them. Several of these
fanatics met their death in the waves; others were
rescued by sailors. The false Moses is said, however,
never to have been found again. It was
against such false hopes as these, whose consequences
were so sad, that Ashi warned the Jews.
At the same time he suggested another interpretation
of the prophecy which had been set in circulation:
"It is certain," said he, "that the Messiah
cannot appear <i>before</i> this time, before the eighty-fifth
jubilee, but after the lapse of this period the
hope, although not the certainty, of his coming may
be entertained." Ashi died, greatly respected by
his contemporaries and the Jews of after-times, at
a ripe old age (427), two years before the capture
of Carthage by Genseric. This Prince of the
Vandals, who wrested from Rome her accumulations
of spoil, also carried to Africa the vessels of the
Temple, which Titus had added in triumph to the
plunder of so many nations. Like the sons of
Judæa, the Temple vessels wandered much.</p>

<p>By reason of the Patriarchate, Judæa was still
regarded as their head by the Jewish communities
of the Roman Empire. During this period it presents
an even more gloomy picture of complete
decay than formerly. The oppression of hostile
Christianity bore all too heavily upon the country,
and stifled the impulse to study. Tanchuma bar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">612</a></span>
Abba, the chief supporter of the later Agada, is the
last Halachic authority of Judæa. There also, as in
Babylonia, the last Amoraïm collected the traditions
and planned and arranged the Jerusalem, or, more
correctly, the Judæan or Western Talmud (Talmud
shel Erez-Israel, Gemara di Bene Ma'araba). But
so defective is the history of Judæa that not even
the names of the compilers or the originators of the
movement are known. Doubtless the example of
Babylonia suggested the making of this collection.
Only so much is certain, that Tiberias, the seat of
the Patriarchate and of the School, was the birthplace
of the Jerusalem Talmud.</p>

<p>It was during this period that the Patriarchate,
the last remnant of former times, met with complete
destruction. Three patriarchs are mentioned by
name: they are Gamaliel V, successor of Hillel II,
his son Judah IV and Gamaliel, the last (370&ndash;425).
But only indistinct traces of their activity can be
recognized. It is true that they still bore the pompous
rather than influential title of Highness, together
with its attendant privileges, and that they still
drew voluntary subsidies from the communities of
the Roman empire, which their envoys were wont to
collect from the congregations. But their authority
was considerably diminished. The sole influence
of the Patriarchs now consisted in the one fact, that
they excluded from the Jewish community its apostate
members, who had gone over to Christianity either
voluntarily or through deceit or persuasion. But
even this power proud Christianity refused to recognize.
By means of the secular arm, the Bishops
compelled the Patriarchs and the heads of the communities,
who bore the name of Primates, to readmit
into the community such of the members as had
been excommunicated. But Theodosius the Great
(379&ndash;395), although continually incited by the
Catholic clergy, Ambrosius, among others, to persecute
the Arians and other heretics, consistently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">613</a></span>
protected the Jews against their fanatical attacks.
He promulgated a law confirming to the Patriarchs
and Primates the right of excommunicating the
members of their community, and forbidding the
secular authorities to meddle with the domestic
affairs of the Jews. He proved to Gamaliel V his
justice towards the Jews by condemning to death the
consular agent Hesychius, whom the Patriarch had
accused before him of surreptitiously gaining possession
of important documents. For the rest,
nothing more is known of the circumstance to which
these documents referred.</p>

<p>Theodosius frequently had to restrain the religious
zeal of the Christians, which regarded as heroism
such deeds as the disturbance of the religious devotions
of the Jews, the pillaging or destruction of
the synagogues, or their appropriation and conversion
into churches. The principal fanatics against
the Jews at this period were John Chrysostom of
Antioch, and Ambrosius of Milan, who attacked
them with the greatest fierceness.</p>

<p>The former, who had been called from the solitude
of the cloister to the ministry, thundered against the
Jews from the pulpit with his bombastic and cynical
eloquence; even made them the subject of six successive
sermons. The behavior of the Jews of
Antioch, however, was indeed too provoking: without
any active endeavor on their part, Christians
became interested in their customs, their divine service,
and their court of law. On Sabbaths and festivals
many Christians, especially of the female sex,
ladies of rank and women of lower position, met
together regularly in the synagogues. They listened
with devotion to the blowing of the cornet on
the Jewish New Year, attended the solemn service
on the Day of Atonement, and participated in the
joys of the Feast of Tabernacles. They were all
the more attracted by the fact that all this had to
go on behind the backs of the Christian priests, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">614</a></span>
that the neighbors had to be entreated not to betray
them. Christians preferred to bring their lawsuits
before Jewish judges, the form of the Jewish oath
appearing more imposing and forcible to them. It
was against such voluntary honoring of Jewish institutions
by the Christians that Chrysostom directed
the violence of his Capuchin sermons, bestowing all
manner of harsh names upon them, and proclaiming
the synagogues as infamous theaters, dens of
robbers, and even still worse places.</p>

<p>Ambrosius, of Milan, was a violent official, ignorant
of all theology, whom a reputation for violence
in the church had raised to the rank of bishop; he
was even more virulent against the Jews. Once
when the Christians of Rome had burnt down a
synagogue, and the usurper Maximus commanded
the Roman Senate to rebuild it at the expense of
the State, Ambrosius called him a Jew. The Bishop
of Callinicus, in Northern Mesopotamia, having
caused a synagogue situated in that district to be
burnt to the ground by monks, Theodosius ordered
him to build it up again at his own expense, and
punished all who had participated in the act (388).
Hereupon Ambrosius' anger was most violently
inflamed, and in the epistle which he addressed to
the emperor he employed such sharp, provoking
terms, that the latter was thereby led to revoke his
order. Ambrosius accused the Jews of despising
the Roman laws, and mockingly taunted them with
the fact that they were not permitted to set up any
emperor or governor in their midst, nor to enter
the army or the Senate, nor even to eat at the table
of the nobles; they were only there for the purpose
of bearing heavy taxes. To this pious misconduct
Theodosius endeavored to put a stop by means of
laws. Starting from the premise that Judaism was
not prohibited from existing in the Roman empire
by any law, he was desirous of extending to it the
protection of the law against violent attacks. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">615</a></span>
therefore enjoined the Comes of the East to severely
punish the Christian religious rioters and desecrators
of synagogues (393). But of what avail
could the imperial edicts and commands be against
the tendency of the times to be malignant, to accuse
of heresy, and to persecute? The Jews could not
complain, for they were not treated any worse than
the adherents of the various Christian sects whose
opponents had gained the upper hand. The savageness
which the invasion of the barbarians had introduced
into the historical parts of the world tainted
the province of religion with its contagion; Vandalism
reigned everywhere, in the Church as well as
in the State. Meanwhile the exceptional position
of the Jews in the Roman empire had been either
re-established or confirmed by Theodosius I. Constantius'
law relative to the possession of slaves
was revived afresh; any Jewish slave-owner who
admitted his slaves into the pale of Judaism was to
be severely punished. The privilege of exemption
from the onerous municipal offices on the grounds
of religious scruples, which the Jews had succeeded
in obtaining under his predecessors, was abolished
by Theodosius.</p>

<p>This emperor bequeathed his dominions to his
two sons, and thus lastingly divided the Roman
world into two parts, and into two different camps,
thereby intensifying the strained and unsympathetic
relations of the different parties to each
other. Henceforward the Jews of the Roman empire
belonged to different masters, part of them
being subjects of the eastern, others of the western
empire. Arcadius, the eastern or Byzantine emperor
(395&ndash;408), was a monarch merely in name;
his all-powerful chamberlains, Rufinus and Eutropius,
were extremely favorable to the Jews. Rufinus
loved money, and the Jews had already discovered
the magic power of gold to soften obdurate
hearts. Numerous laws were therefore promulgated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">616</a></span>
in their favor. One of these laws decided (396)
that the Jews should remain possessed of independence
in the matter of choosing their own market
inspectors (Agoranomos), and that whosoever should
dare encroach on this right should be liable to
severe punishment by imprisonment. Another law
of the same year protected the "illustrious patriarchs"
from insult. In Illyria synagogues were
attacked, probably by the clergy, who would have
liked to see the Jewish houses of prayer as completely
destroyed as the heathen temples; thereupon
Arcadius (or Eutropius) commanded the governors
to resist this movement with all possible
energy (397). In the same year he also re-enacted
and confirmed the law of Constantius, whereby the
patriarchs, as also all the religious officials of the
synagogue, were exempted from the burden of the
magistracy, as were the Christian clergy. Another
right was also preserved to the Jews by Arcadius'
administration (February, 398); they were allowed
to retain the privilege of submitting their lawsuits
to the patriarch and other Jewish arbitrators, if
both parties consented to this course, and the
Roman authorities were obliged to execute these
judgments, without prejudice to the fact, however,
that in so far as their religion was not concerned,
they were subject to the Roman law. We must
not be surprised by a capricious change under the
arbitrary rule of the Byzantine court: a law was
published in 399, subjecting all Jews, even the religious
superiors, to the Curial burdens. This had,
perhaps, some connection with Eutropius' fall in the
same year.</p>

<p>Not much is known of the course of conduct pursued
towards the Jews by the Emperor of the West,
the feeble Honorius, or his master, Stilicho. The
abolition of exemption from the Curies pronounced
against the communities of Apuleia and Calabria
does not prove that a systematic hostility already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">617</a></span>
existed against the Jews. Another law (of April,
399) forbade, in the name of the Western Emperor
Honorius, and under severe penalty, the collection
of the patriarch's tax throughout the whole extent
of the prefecture. Such sums as had already been
received were confiscated to the imperial treasury.
The motive of this prohibition may, however, have
been that the Western Emperor regarded with envious
eye the withdrawal of such considerable sums
into the prefecture of his brother. But as if the
legislation of this period desired to ridicule its own
capriciousness, this prohibition was revoked five
years later, and the Jews were henceforward permitted
to collect the Patriarch's tax as before, and
to forward it without concealment (404). While
on the one hand Honorius forbade the Jews and the
Samaritans to take any share in the military service,
on the other hand, he protected the Jews from
molestation on the part of the authorities, and decided
by an edict that the Jews should not be
summoned before the court on the Sabbath or the
festivals (409).</p>

<p>The Middle Ages really begin for Judaism with
Theodosius II (408&ndash;450), a good-natured but monk-ridden
emperor, whose weakness afforded impunity
to the fanatical zeal of many a bishop, and offered
encouragement to cruelty. Edicts of this emperor
prohibited the Jews from building new synagogues,
from exercising the office of judge between Jewish
and Christian suitors, and from possessing Christian
slaves; they also contained other prohibitions of
less interest. It was under this emperor that the
Patriarchate finally fell, although Gamaliel (Batraah),
the last of the patriarchs, enjoyed great distinction at
the imperial court, such as none of his predecessors
had ever possessed. Beside the title which had
long been borne by the Patriarchs, the high dignity
of Prefect (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Præfectura</i>), together with a diploma of
honor (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">codicillus honorarius</i>), had been bestowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">618</a></span>
upon him, and although these were but hollow
honors, they were of great importance at a time
when appearances constituted everything. It is not
known what was the particular merit for which
Gamaliel gained this distinction, but it was probably
on account of his medical acquirements. He was
a physician, and was credited with the discovery of
a much-approved remedy for diseases of the spleen.
In this elevated position Gamaliel considered himself
privileged to be lax in his observance of the
emperor's exceptional laws against the Jews. He
therefore built new synagogues, exercised jurisdiction
in disputes between Jews and Christians, and
disregarded other similar imperial commands. In
consequence of this, Theodosius deprived him of
all his higher dignities, took from him his diploma
of honor, and suffered him to retain only such
distinctions as he had enjoyed as Patriarch (415).
But Theodosius in nowise abolished the Patriarchate
during Gamaliel's lifetime; it was not until
after the latter's death that this occurred, his male
heirs having died, it appears, at an early age
(425). Thus, with Gamaliel (Batraah) the last remnants
of the noble stock of the house of Hillel
disappeared. For three and a half centuries this
house had stood at the head of the spiritual affairs
of Judaism; many of its members had been promoters
of the Law, of liberty, and of national
feeling, and the history of their lives had become
an important part of the history of the Jewish
nation. Fifteen Patriarchs had succeeded each
other during this lapse of time; two Hillels, three
Simons, four Judahs, and six Gamaliels.</p>

<p>During the reign of Theodosius in the East, and
Honorius in the West, Cyril, Bishop of Alexandria,
notorious for his love of quarreling, his violence,
and his impetuousness, was suffered to illtreat the
Jews and to drive them out of that town. He
assembled the Christian mob, incited them against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">619</a></span>
the Jews by his excessive fanaticism, forced his way
into the synagogues, of which he took possession
for the Christians, and expelled the Jewish inhabitants
half naked from the town which they had
come to regard as their home. Disdaining no
means, Cyril handed over their property to be
pillaged by the mob, ever greedy of plunder (415).
Thus the Christians inflicted on the Jews of Alexandria
the same fate as 370 years before had fallen
to their lot at the hands of the heathens. The
Prefect Orestes, who took this barbarous treatment
of the Jews greatly to heart, was powerless to
protect them; all he was able to do was to lodge a
charge against the bishop, but the latter gained his
cause at the court of Constantinople. How great
was the fanaticism of this bishop may be seen from
what occurred in Alexandria soon after the expulsion
of the Jews. Not far from this city was a mountain
called Nitra, where dwelt an order of monks whose
thirst for the crown of martyrdom had almost made
wild animals of them. Incited by Cyril, these monks
fell upon Orestes, and almost stoned him to death
as a punishment for not sanctioning the expulsion
of the Jews. It was this same fanatical band that
tore to pieces the body of the celebrated philosopher
Hypatia, who had charmed the world by her profound
science, her eloquence, and her purity. Only
one member of this unlucky community of Jews,
Adamantius by name, a teacher of the science of
medicine, was induced by this disaster to allow
himself to be baptized; he repaired to Constantinople,
and was there granted the right to settle
in Alexandria. All the rest willingly bore banishment
and affliction for the sake of their convictions.</p>

<p>Not so resolute were the Jews of the little town
of Magona (Mahon) in the Spanish island of
Minorca, in the Mediterranean. Severus, the bishop
of that place, burnt their synagogues, and harassed
them with attacks in the streets, until at last he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620">620</a></span>
succeeded in compelling many of them to embrace
Christianity. The Jews had settled early&mdash;probably
in the time of the Roman Republic&mdash;in Spain
and in the surrounding islands, and lived there
in friendly relation with the original inhabitants.
Even after the Iberians had become Christians,
the husbandmen still caused the produce of
their fields to be blessed by the Jews. It was in
Spain that the Christian clergy first aroused the
fanaticism of the Christian population against the
Jews. The same bishop Osius (Hosius) of Cordova,
who had sat in the Council of Nice, and had convoked
a council at Illiberis (Elvira, near Granada),
also succeeded in passing a resolution which prohibited
the Christians, under pain of excommunication,
from trading with the Jews, contracting
marriages with them, or causing them to bless the
produce of their fields. Nothing now remained for
the Jews of Christian countries but to take up the
weapons of mockery; they accordingly made merry
over their enemies behind their backs, which has
everywhere and at all times been the manner in
which the weaker party has attempted to lighten
its burdens. At times also they made use of coarse
jokes to express their feelings with regard to
Christianity. Such jokes were most usually made
on the occasion of the feast of Purim, when the
cheerfulness of the festival led to intoxication, and
intoxication to irresponsible expressions and demonstrations.
On this day the Jews in their merriment
were accustomed to hang Haman, their arch-enemy,
in effigy on a gallows, and this gallows, which used
afterwards to be burned, took, accidentally or
intentionally, the form of a cross. Naturally the
Christians complained of profanation of their
religion, and the Emperor Theodosius II directed
the ruler of the province to put a stop to such
misconduct by the threat of severe punishment,
without being able, however, to repress it. On one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">621</a></span>
occasion this carnival pleasantry is said to have led
to horrible consequences. The Jews of Imnestar,
a small Syrian town between Antioch and Chalcis,
having erected one of these Haman's gallows,
were accused by the Christians of having suspended
a Christian lad crosswise upon it, and of having
flogged him to death. Thereupon the emperor
ordered the culprits to be punished (415).</p>

<p>The Christians of Antioch were not inferior to
their brethren of Alexandria in fanaticism. They
once begged the emperor not to remove the bones
and relics of their martyr Ignatius, as they afforded
their city as great a protection as strong walls.
They also, on their side, avenged the deed of the
Jews of Imnestar, by forcibly dispossessing their
Jewish fellow-citizens of their synagogues. It is
a remarkable phenomenon that the prefects and
rulers of the provinces for the most part expressed
themselves in favor of the Jews against the clergy.
The Syrian prefect notified the emperor of this
robbery of the synagogues, and must have painted
this act of injustice in very vivid colors, for he
thereby moved Theodosius II, steeped as he was
in monkish bigotry, to issue an injunction to the
inhabitants of Antioch, ordering them to restore
the synagogues to their owners. But this decision
was denounced by Simon Stylites, who led a
life of extreme asceticism in a sort of stable not far
from Antioch. From the height of his column he
had renounced the world and its ways, but his
hatred of the Jews was sufficient, nevertheless, to
cause him to interpose in temporal matters. Hardly
had he heard of Theodosius' command relative to
the restoration of the stolen synagogues, than he
addressed an insulting letter to the emperor,
informing him that he acknowledged God alone,
and no one else, as master and emperor, and
demanded the withdrawal of the edict. Theodosius
hardly stood in need of such intimidation; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">622</a></span>
revoked his command, and even removed the
Syrian prefect, who had raised his voice in favor of
the Jews (423).</p>

<p>The bigotry of Theodosius II operated also on
Honorius, Emperor of the West, and by their absurd
laws both of them placed the Jews in that exceptional
position in which the newly-formed German
states found them. The Jews were no longer
allowed to hold any public offices, or to fill any
military posts such as they had formerly been permitted
to occupy. All that now remained open to
them were the doubtful honors of the municipal
offices; but not content with having deprived them
of their position of equality, Theodosius restricted
the free employment of their property for religious
purposes, as if the fortunes of the Jews belonged
to the emperor. After the extinction of the patriarchal
house the Jewish communities had not discontinued
their practice of forwarding the taxes of
the Patriarch; they were handed over to the primates,
who most probably employed them in supporting
the schools. Suddenly there appeared an
imperial decree directing the primates to deliver up
to the imperial treasury such sums as had already
been received for the Patriarch's taxes, and commanding
that for the future they should be collected
by imperial officials after exact computation of their
amount, and even that the moneys received from
the Western empire should be handed over to the
treasury (May 30, 429). New Rome had inherited
all the knavery and covetousness of Ancient Rome.
In the same manner as the heathen emperor Vespasian
had appropriated the Temple dues, so now
did this Christian emperor seize upon the taxes of
the Patriarch, thus adding to the injury of the
robbery an insult to the conscience, for that which
had been voluntarily offered out of piety was now
imposed as a compulsory tax for the benefit of
foreign interests.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">623</a></span>
In spite of the affliction which fell to the lot of
Judaism in the Eastern empire, and more especially
in Judæa, whereby the study of the Talmud was
retarded, the spirit of investigation had not become
quite extinct in Judæa. The reigning distress
offered no scope for the profundities of the Halacha,
but furthered the study of the cheerful Agada,
which, diving deep into the joyful and gloomy situations
of past ages, poured the balm of consolation
on fretted and desperate spirits, and lulled them
with the magic of hope. The more clear-sighted
were fully conscious of this decay of serious
studies, and expressed their discontent. Notwithstanding
the prevailing injustice of the times, a
lively interest in the Hebrew language and in the
knowledge of the Bible was still felt in Palestine.
It is indisputable that this interest in the language
was greatly heightened by the controversies which
were sustained with Christians, and to such a pitch
was it excited at this period, that by its help Christianity
arrived at an understanding of the primitive
text of the Bible. Tiberias was the home and the
model of this branch of knowledge; Lydda is the
only other town which is mentioned beside it.
Hieronymus (Jerome, 331&ndash;420), called by the Church
the Holy, the founder of a nunnery in Bethlehem,
being actuated, like Origen, by a thirst for knowledge,
was at pains to become acquainted with the
Bible in its original form, and for this reason went
in quest of Jewish teachers, such as Bar-Chanina
and others in these cities. Under their guidance,
Hieronymus' acquirements were by no means small,
for he succeeded in expressing himself freely in
Hebrew. From this circumstance it may fairly be
concluded that the knowledge of the holy tongue
and of the Bible was more assiduously cultivated in
Judæa than has generally been assumed. Bar-Chanina
was obliged, however, to avoid publicity,
and to go in secret to Hieronymus' cell, there to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">624</a></span>
instruct him, for by reason of the hostile use to
which the Christians turned their knowledge of the
Hebrew language, it had latterly been forbidden to
the Jews to teach them. Hieronymus not only
learnt the pronunciation of Hebrew and the literal
meaning of the Bible, but was afforded a more profound
insight into the interconnection of the text by
the aid of tradition. He succeeded so well in catching
the form of the Agadic exposition, that at times
he was able to carry it over with taste and ingenuity
into the sphere of Christianity.</p>

<p>The Jews were several centuries ahead of their
Christian contemporaries as regards judging and
distinguishing between authentic canonical writings
and spurious apocryphal collections. The Council
of Nice, which had thought to unite parties by means
of authoritative decisions, had decided the dispute
as to the holy character of doubtful writings, and
had incorporated several apocryphal books in the
canon. The Jews with whom Hieronymus held conferences
on matters exegetical, offered such sound
remarks on the worthlessness of several portions of
the Apocrypha that even at this day, when knowledge
has made such immense strides, they must be
acknowledged as correct. Among others, a Jewish
teacher of the Law ridiculed the additions to Habakkuk,
according to which an angel transported the
prophet by the hair from Judæa to Chaldæa. He
demanded where in the Old Testament could be
found a counterpart to this story of one of the holy
prophets, possessed of a body subject to the power
of gravity, traversing so immense a distance in a
moment. In spite of the unpropitious state of
the times, the Jews of Palestine were not afflicted
with that want of judgment which in naïve faith
accepts without discrimination as holy anything that
is put forward as such; they had not extinguished
the light of discernment in the temple of their faith.
This power of judgment was a result of the study<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_625" id="Page_625">625</a></span>
of the Halacha, which afforded a counterpoise to the
incapacity of discrimination which is a consequence
of credulity. Thus even in its old age Judæa fostered
the Hebrew tongue, which it had given to its sons
as an indissoluble bond of union in foreign countries.
The use of the holy language in prayer, lecture, and
study constituted the intellectual unity of the Jewish
nation.</p>

<p>Christianity had caught up a few rays of the
setting sun of Judæa, and treasured them up in the
Church as a light from heaven. The knowledge of
Hebrew, which Hieronymus had acquired from
Jewish teachers, and by means of which he had been
enabled to produce a Latin translation (Vulgata) of
the Bible, deviating from the distorted Septuagint
and approaching more nearly to the Hebrew text,
sufficed for more than a thousand years, and was
extended and amended with the renaissance of
learning at the commencement of modern times.
But with every step forward that Christianity took,
it increased the gap which divided it from Judaism,
and the eloquence of many centuries was required
before recognition was again obtained for the fact
that Christianity had had its origin in Judaism. To
such an extent had blood-relationship been obliterated
by religious zeal, that even Hieronymus,
who had sat at the feet of Jewish masters, and
had found "the Hebrew truth" in the Old Testament,
was unable to free himself from the deep-rooted
hatred of the Jews. His enemies having
reproached him with heresy on account of his Jewish
studies, he convinced them of his orthodoxy by his
hatred of the Jews. "If it is requisite to despise
the individuals and the nation, so do I abhor the
Jews with an inexpressible hate." In this he was
not alone, for his opinions were shared by a younger
contemporary, Augustine, the Father of the Church.
This profession of faith concerning the hatred of the
Jews was not the private opinion of an individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">626</a></span>
author, but an oracle for the whole of Christendom,
which readily accepted the writings of the Fathers
of the Church, who were revered as saints. In
later times this profession of faith armed kings and
populace, crusaders and herdsmen, against the Jews,
invented instruments for their torture, and constructed
funeral pyres for burning them.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that in spite of their repression
on the part of the state, the Jews living in Cæsarea,
the residence of the Governor, joined in the
fashionable folly of the stadium. There existed
among them charioteers, horse-racers, jockeys, and
parties supporting the green or the blue, as at
Rome, Ravenna, Constantinople, and Antioch. But
as in those times every act in life bore the stamp
of the confessional, religious disputes also became
mixed up with the struggles of the partisans of
the various colors. The victory or the defeat of a
Jewish, Samaritan, or Christian charioteer was at
the same time the occasion of an attack by his
co-religionists upon their opponents.</p>

<p>In Babylonia, where up till now the Jews had
enjoyed quiet and independence but seldom disturbed,
troubles and persecutions also began to
increase. It was for this reason that a dearth of
prominent personages began to make itself felt.
Creative power declined, and made way for the
tendency to reproduce and establish what had
already been produced. The Jewish history of this
country moved within a narrow circle; the principals
of the schools succeeded one another, taught, and
died, and it was only by the appearance of persecutions
that a sad variety was imparted to its course.
Of Ashi's six successors at the Academy of Sora
(427&ndash;456), not one accomplished anything worthy of
remark.</p>

<p>Some small importance was possessed, however,
by Ashi's son, Mar, who also bore the name Tabyome.
He happened to be at Machuza at the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627">627</a></span>
when he heard the news of the occurrence of a
vacancy at the head of the Soranian Metibta. He
hurried off to Sora, and arrived there just in the
nick of time, for the members of the academy were
assembled for the election. Delegates were sent
to confer with him on the choice of Acha of Diphta,
and were detained by him, as were also others
who were sent after them, until they were ten in
number; whereupon he delivered a lecture, and was
hailed as Resh-Metibta by all the members present
(455). Acha was exceedingly hurt by this slight,
and applied to his own case the following saying,
"He who is unlucky, can never attain to luck."</p>

<p>In the same year a persecution of the Jews broke
out with unprecedented rigor in the Babylonian
countries. It was the commencement of a long
series of bloody attacks which the Jews had to
suffer at the hands of the last of the neo-Persian
kings, and which rendered their position as sad as
that of their co-religionists of the Roman Empire.
Jezdijird III (440&ndash;457), unlike his predecessor of
the same name, instituted a religious persecution
of the Jews; they were forbidden to celebrate the
Sabbath (456). The reason of this sudden change
in the conduct of the Persian ruler towards the
Jews, who had always been sincerely attached to
him, is probably to be found in the fanaticism of
the Magi, whose influence over many of the Persian
monarchs was not less than that of the spiritual
advisers of the eastern emperors over their masters.
The Magi of this period appear to have learnt
their proselytism and their love of religious persecution
from the Christians. Besides this, Christianity
had by its proselytism provoked the Magi
to resistance. The Manicheans who had compounded
Jewish, Christian, and Persian religious
ideas into a medley of their own, made accusations
of heresy as common in Persia as in the Roman
Empire. Jezdijird persecuted both Manicheans and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_628" id="Page_628">628</a></span>
Christians. Sooner or later the light-worship of the
Persians was bound to take offense at Judaism, and
to place the Jews upon the list of its enemies. The
chronicles are silent concerning the conduct of the
Jews with regard to the prohibition of the celebration
of the Sabbath; conscientious Jews, however,
cannot have failed to obtain opportunities of
evading it, and for this reason the names of no
martyrs have survived this persecution. The constraint
was continued about a year, as Jezdijird
was killed a short time after; a civil war was
carried on by his sons Chodar-Warda and Firuz for
the possession of the crown.</p>

<p>Mar bar Ashi was the sole authority of this
period; and although all his decisions, with the
exception of three, received the force of law, he
does not seem to have acquired any special repute
in the Soranian Academy. He continued his
father's work of completing the Talmudical collection,
and included the latter's decisions therein.
He and his contemporaries must have felt themselves
all the more impelled to complete the work
of compilation, as the persecution they had gone
through made them feel that the future was precarious.
Nothing more is known of Mar bar
Ashi's character than a trait of conscientiousness,
which stands out in strong contrast with Raba's
partiality towards members of his own class. He
relates as follows: "When an associate appears
before me in court, I refuse to exercise the functions
of my office, for I regard him as a near relation,
and might involuntarily show partiality in his favor."</p>

<p>After Mar's death the Jews of the Persian Empire
were the victims of a fresh persecution under Firuz
(Pheroces, 457&ndash;484), which was far more terrible
than that which had occurred under his father,
Jezdijird. This persecution is said to have been
occasioned by the desire for vengeance entertained
by this monarch, who was swayed by the Magi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629">629</a></span>
against the whole Jewish community, because
certain of them were said to have killed and flayed
two Magi in Ispahan. As a punishment for this
deed Firuz put to death half the Jewish population
of Ispahan, and had the Jewish children forcibly
brought up in the Temple of Horvan as worshipers
of fire. The persecution extended also to the
communities of Babylonia, and continued for several
years, until the death of the tyrant. Mar-Zutra's
son, Huna-Mari, Prince of the Captivity, and two
teachers of the Law, Amemar bar Mar-Janka and
Meshershaya bar Pacod, were thrown into prison,
and afterwards executed (469&ndash;70). They were
the first martyrs on Babylonian soil, and it is a
significant fact that a Prince of the Captivity bled
for Judaism.</p>

<p>A few years later the persecution was carried to
a still wider extent; the schools were closed, assemblies
for the purpose of teaching prohibited, the
jurisdiction of the Jews abolished, and their children
compelled to embrace the religion of the Magi (474).</p>

<p>The city of Sora seems to have been destroyed
at this period. Firuz, whose system of persecution
puts one in mind of Hadrian, invented a new means
of torture, which had not occurred to that emperor,
which was to remove the young from under the
influence of Judaism, and to bring them up by force
in the Persian religion. For this reason he was
branded by the Jews of after times, like Hadrian,
with the name of "the wicked" (<i xml:lang="he" lang="he">Piruz Reshia</i>).
The immediate result of this persecution was the
emigration of Jewish colonists, who settled in the
south as far as Arabia, and in the east as far as India.</p>

<p>This emigration of the Jews to India is expressly
marked as occurring about the time of Firuz's persecution.
An otherwise unknown person, Joseph
Rabban by name, who is recognizable as a Babylonian
by reason of this title, arrived in the year
4250 of the Jewish era (490), with many Jewish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">630</a></span>
families, on the rich and busy coast of Malabar; he
must accordingly have started on his journey before
this date, and therefore have emigrated under Firuz.
Airvi (Eravi), the Brahmin king of Cranganor,
welcomed the Jewish strangers, offered them a
home in his dominions, and suffered them to live
according to their peculiar laws, and to be ruled by
their own princes (Mardeliar). The first of these
chiefs was their leader Joseph Rabban, upon whom
the Indian monarch conferred special rights and
princely honors, to be inherited by his descendants.
He was allowed, like the Indian princes, to ride
upon an elephant, to be preceded by a herald,
accompanied by a musical escort of drums and
cymbals, and to sit upon a carpet. Joseph Rabban
is said to have been followed by a line of seventy-two
successors, who ruled over the Indo-Jewish
colonists, until quarrels broke out among them.
Cranganor was destroyed, many of the Jews lost
their lives, and the remainder settled in Mattachery,
a league from Cochin, which acquired from this
fact the name of Jews'-town. The privileges
accorded by Airvi to the Jewish immigrants were
engraved in ancient Indian (Tamil) characters,
accompanied by an obscure Hebrew translation, on
a copper table, which is said to be extant at the
present day.</p>

<p>As soon as the terrors of persecution had ceased
with Firuz's death, the ancient organization was
again restored in Jewish Babylonia; the academies
were re-opened, principals appointed, and Sora and
Pumbeditha received their last Amoraïc leaders&mdash;the
former in the person of Rabina, the latter in
José. These two principals and their assessors had
but one end in view, the completion and termination
of the work of compiling the Talmud begun by
Ashi. The continual increase of affliction, the diminished
interest which probably on that account was
extended to study, the uncertainty of the future, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631">631</a></span>
these causes forcibly suggested the completion of the
Talmud. Rabina, who held office from 488 to 499,
and José, who discharged the duties of principal
from 471 to about 520, are expressly mentioned in
the old chronicles as "the close of the period of the
Amoraïm" (<i xml:lang="he" lang="he">Sof Horaah</i>). There is no doubt,
however, that the members of the two academies,
whose names have been preserved, also had a part
in this work, and that they therefore are to be
regarded as the last of the Amoraïm. The most
important among them was Achaï bar Huna of Be-Chatim,
near Nahardea (died 506), whose decisions
and discussions are distinguished by characteristic
peculiarities, and bear witness to a clear and sober
mind, and to great keenness. Achaï was known
and esteemed for these qualities beyond Babylonia.
An epistle received by the Babylonian academy
from Judæa, which, as far as is historically
known, was probably the last addressed by the
deserted mother-country to its daughter colony,
speaks of him in terms of greatest reverence:
"Neglect not Achaï, for he is the light of the eyes
of the exiles." Even Huna-Mar, the Prince of the
Captivity, must have possessed Talmudical acquirements,
for the chronicle, which is by no means
favorable to the princes of the Captivity, numbers
him among this series of teachers of the Law, and
concedes to him the title of Rabbi. His history, with
which certain important events are connected,
belongs to the following period.</p>

<p>In conjunction with these men, Rabina and José
accomplished the completion of the Talmud, that
is to say, they sanctioned as a complete whole the
collection of all previous transactions and decisions
which they had caused to be compiled, and to which
no additions or amplifications were henceforward to
be made. The definite completion of the Babylonian
Talmud (called also the Gemara) occurred in
the year of Rabina's death, just at the close of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_632" id="Page_632">632</a></span>
fifth century (13th Kislev or 2nd December, 499),
when the Jews of the Arabian peninsula were sowing
the first seeds of a new religion and laying the
foundations of a new empire, and when the Gothic
and Frankish kingdoms were rising in Europe from
the ruins of ancient Rome. The Talmud forms a
turning-point in Jewish history, and from this time
forward constitutes an essential factor therein.</p>

<p>The Talmud must not be regarded as an ordinary
work, composed of twelve volumes; it possesses
absolutely no similarity to any other literary production,
but forms, without any figure of speech,
a world of its own, which must be judged by its
peculiar laws. It is extremely difficult to give
any sketch of its character because of the absence
of all common standards and analogies. The most
talented could, therefore, hardly hope to succeed in
this task, even though he had penetrated deeply
into its nature, and become intimately acquainted
with its peculiarities. It might, perhaps, be compared
with the literature of the Fathers of the
Church, which sprang up about the same time; but
on closer examination even this comparison fails
to satisfy the student. It is, however, of less
consequence what the Talmud is in itself, than
what was its influence on history, that is to say,
on the successive generations whose education
it chiefly controlled. Many judgments have been
passed on the Talmud at various times and on the
most opposite grounds. It has been condemned,
and its funeral pyre has been ignited, because only
its unfavorable side has been considered, and no
regard has been paid to its merits, which, however,
can be rendered apparent only by a complete survey
of the whole of Jewish history. It cannot be denied,
however, that the Babylonian Talmud is marred by
certain blemishes, such as necessarily appear in
every intellectual production which pursues a single
course with inflexible consistency and exclusive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633">633</a></span>
one-sidedness. These faults may be classed under
four heads. The Talmud contains much that is
immaterial and frivolous, of which it treats with
great gravity and seriousness; it further reflects
the various superstitious practices and views of
its Persian birthplace, which presume the efficacy
of demoniacal medicines, of magic, incantations,
miraculous cures, and interpretations of dreams,
and are thus in opposition to the spirit of Judaism.
It also contains isolated instances of uncharitable
judgments and decrees against the members of
other nations and religions, and finally it favors an
incorrect exposition of the Scriptures, accepting, as
it does, tasteless misinterpretations. The whole
Talmud has been made responsible for these defects,
and has been condemned as a collection of trifles, a
well of immorality and falsehood. No consideration
has been paid to the fact that it is not the work of
any one author, who must answer for every word
of it, or if it be, that that author is the entire Jewish
nation. More than six centuries lie petrified in the
Talmud as the fullest evidence of life, clothed each
in its peculiar dress and possessing its own form of
thought and expression: a sort of literary Herculaneum
and Pompeii, unmarred by that artificial
imitation which transfers a gigantic picture on a
reduced scale to a narrow canvas. Small wonder,
then, that if in this world the sublime and the
common, the great and the small, the grave and the
ridiculous, the altar and the ashes, the Jewish and
the heathenish, be discovered side by side. The
expressions of ill-will, which are seized upon with
such avidity by the enemies of the Jews, were often
nothing but the utterance of momentary ill-humor,
which escaped from the teacher, and were caught
up and embodied in the Talmud by over-zealous
disciples, unwilling to lose a single word let fall by
the revered sages. They are amply counterbalanced,
however, by the doctrines of benevolence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_634" id="Page_634">634</a></span>
and love of all men without distinction of race or
religion, which are also preserved in the Talmud.
As a counterpoise to the wild superstitions, there
are severe warnings against superstitious heathen
practices, to which a separate section is devoted.</p>

<p>The Babylonian Talmud is especially distinguished
from the Jerusalem or Palestine Talmud by the
flights of thought, the penetration of mind, the
flashes of genius, which rise and vanish again. An
infinite fulness of thought and of thought-exciting
material is laid up in the mine of the Talmud, not,
however, in the shape of a finished theme which one
can grasp at a glance, but in all its original freshness
of conception. The Talmud introduces us
into the laboratory of thought, and in it may be
traced the progress of ideas, from their earliest
agitation to the giddy height of incomprehensibility
to which at times they attain. It was for this
reason that the Babylonian rather than the Jerusalem
Talmud became the fundamental possession of the
Jewish race, its life's breath, its very soul. It was
a family history for succeeding generations, in which
they felt themselves at home, in which they lived and
moved, the thinker in the world of thought, the
dreamer in glorious ideal pictures. For more than
a thousand years the external world, nature and
mankind, powers and events, were for the Jewish
nation insignificant, non-essential, a mere phantom;
the only true reality was the Talmud. A new
truth in their eyes only received the stamp of
veracity and freedom from doubt when it appeared
to be foreseen and sanctioned by the Talmud.
Even the knowledge of the Bible, the more ancient
history of their race, the words of fire and balm
of their prophets, the soul outpourings of their
Psalmists, were only known to them through and
in the light of the Talmud. But as Judaism, ever
since its foundation, has based itself on the experiences
of actual life, so that the Talmud was obliged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_635" id="Page_635">635</a></span>
to concern itself with concrete phenomena, with the
things of <i>this</i> world; so it follows that there could
not arise that dream-life, that disdain of the world,
that hatred of realities, which in the Middle Ages
gave birth to and sanctified the hermit life of the
monks and nuns. It is true that the intellectual
tendency prevailing in the Babylonian Talmud,
aided by climatic influences and other accidental
circumstances, degenerated not infrequently into
subtilty and scholasticism; for no historical phenomenon
exists without an unfavorable side. But even
this abuse contributed to bring about clear conceptions,
and rendered possible the movement toward
science. The Babylonian Amoraïm created that
dialectic, close-reasoning, Jewish spirit, which in the
darkest days preserved the dispersed nation from
stagnation and stupidity. It was the ether which
protected them from corruption, the ever-moving
force which overcame indolence and the blunting of
the mental powers, the eternal spring which kept
the mind ever bright and active. In a word, the
Talmud was the educator of the Jewish nation; and
this education can by no means have been a bad
one, since, in spite of the disturbing influence of
isolation, degradation and systematic demoralization,
it fostered in the Jewish people a degree of morality
which even their enemies cannot deny them. The
Talmud preserved and promoted the religious and
moral life of Judaism; it held out a banner to
the communities scattered in all corners of the
earth, and protected them from schism and sectarian
divisions; it acquainted subsequent generations
with the history of their nation; finally, it produced
a deep intellectual life which preserved the enslaved
and proscribed from stagnation, and which lit for them
the torch of science. How the Talmud made its way
into the consciousness of the Jewish people, how it
became known and accessible to distant communities,
and how it became a stumbling-block to the enemies
of Judaism, will be told in subsequent pages.</p>
